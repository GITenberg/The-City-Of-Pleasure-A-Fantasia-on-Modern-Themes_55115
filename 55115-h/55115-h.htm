    </p>
    <p>
      One of the three richly-uniformed officials who were in charge of the
      captive balloon, destined to be a leading attraction of the City of
      Pleasure, murmured this name warningly to his companions, as if to advise
      them that the moment had arrived for them to mind their p&rsquo;s and q&rsquo;s. And
      each man looked cautiously through the tail of his eye at a striking
      figure which was approaching through crowds of people to the enclosure.
      The figure was tall and had red hair and a masterful face, and it was
      clothed in a blue suit that set off the red hair to perfection. Over the
      wicket of the enclosure a small enamelled sign had been hung:
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;CITY OF PLEASURE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>President</i>: Josephus Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Managing and Musical Director</i>: Charles Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Balloon Ascents every half-hour after three o&rsquo;clock. Height of a
      thousand feet guaranteed. Seats, half-a-crown, including field-glass</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sign was slightly askew, and the approaching figure tapped it into
      position, and then entered the enclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;Everything ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;d afternoon, Mr. Carpentaria,&rdquo; said the head balloonist
      respectfully. &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three men with considerable ostentation busied themselves among ropes,
      while a young man in gold-rimmed spectacles gazed with sudden
      self-consciousness into the far distance, just as if he had that very
      instant discovered something there that demanded the whole of his
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going up, sir?&rdquo; inquired the head balloonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Carpentaria. &ldquo;Mr. Ilam and I are going up together. We have
      time, haven&rsquo;t we? It&rsquo;s only half-past two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria examined the vast balloon, which was trembling and swaying and
      lugging with that aspiration towards heaven and the infinite so
      characteristic of well-filled balloons. He ignored the young man in
      spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the parachutist?&rdquo; Carpentaria demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A parachutist was to give éclat to the first public ascent of the silken
      monster by dropping from it into the Thames or somewhere else. His
      apparatus hung beneath the great circular car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be here before three, sir,&rdquo; said the head balloonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been here once, sir,&rdquo; added the second balloonist, anxious to prove
      to himself that he also had the right to converse with the mighty
      Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few seconds later the august President arrived. Mr. Josephus Ilam was
      tall, like his partner, but much stouter. He had, indeed, almost the
      inflated appearance which one observes constantly in the drivers of
      brewers&rsquo; drays; even his fingers bulged. His age was fifty, ten years more
      than that of Carpentaria, and it was probably ten years since he had seen
      his own feet. Finally, he was clean-shaven, with areas of blue on his chin
      and cheeks like the sea on a map, and his hair&mdash;what remained of it&mdash;seemed
      to be hesitating between black and grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked of Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I thought I would just like to make the first ascent with you alone,&rdquo;
       Carpentaria answered, and added, smiling, &ldquo;I have something to show you up
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hand indicated the firmament, and his peculiar smile indicated that he
      took Ilam&rsquo;s consent for granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilam sighed obesely, and agreed. He did not care to argue before members
      of the staff. Nevertheless, the futility of ascending to the skies on
      this, the opening day, when the colossal organism of the show cried aloud
      for continual supervision on earth, was sufficiently clear to his mind. He
      climbed gingerly over the edge of the wickerwork car, which had a
      circumference of thirty feet, with a protected aperture in the middle, and
      Carpentaria followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, gleefully. &ldquo;Let go!&rdquo; he repeated with
      impatience, when the balloon was arrested at a height of about ten feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right sir,&rdquo; responded briskly the head balloonist. There appeared to have
      been some altercation between the balloonists.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was the first of May, but the London spring had chosen to be
      capricious and unseasonable. Instead of the snow and frost and east wind
      which almost invariably accompany what is termed, with ferocious irony,
      the merry month, there was strong, brilliant sunshine and a perfect calm.
      The sun glinted and glittered on the upper surfaces of the balloon, but of
      course the voyagers could not perceive that. They, in fact, perceived
      nothing except that the entire world was gradually falling away from them.
      The balloon had ceased to shiver; it stood as firm as consols, while the
      City of Pleasure sank and sank, and the upturned faces of more than fifty
      thousand spectators grew tinier and tinier.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be interesting and certainly instructive to unfold some of the
      many mysteries and minor dramas which had diversified the history of the
      making of the City of Pleasure, from the time when Carpentaria, having
      conceived the idea of the thing, found the necessary millionaire in the
      person of Josephus Ilam, to the hurried and tumultuous eve of the opening
      day; but these are unconnected with the present recital. It needs only to
      remind the reader of the City&rsquo;s geography. Towards the lower left-hand
      corner of any map of London not later than 1905, may be observed a large,
      nearly empty space in the form of an inverted letter &ldquo;U.&rdquo; This space is
      bounded everywhere, except across the bottom, by the Thames. It is indeed
      a peninsula made by an extraordinary curve of the Thames, and Barnes
      Common connects if with the mainland of the parish of Putney. Its
      dimensions are little short of a mile either way, and yet, although
      Hammersmith Bridge joins it to Hammersmith at the top, it was almost
      uninhabited, save for the houses which lined Bridge Road and a scattering
      of houses in Lonsdale Road and the short streets between Lonsdale Road and
      the reservoir near the bridge. The contrast was violent; on the north side
      of the Thames the crowded populousness of Hammersmith, and on the south
      side&mdash;well, possibly four people to the acre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilam and Carpentaria, with Ilam&rsquo;s money, bought or leased the whole of the
      middle part of the peninsula&mdash;over three hundred acres&mdash;with a
      glorious half-mile frontage to the Thames on the east side. They would
      have acquired all the earth as far as Barnes Common but for the fact that
      the monomaniacs of the Ranelagh Club Golf Course could not be induced to
      part with their links, even when offered a fantastic number of thousand
      pounds per hole. They obtained the closing of the Bridge Road, which cut
      the peninsula downwards into two halves, and the omnibus traffic between
      Hammersmith and Barnes was diverted to Lonsdale Road&mdash;not without
      terrific diplomacy, and pitched battles in the columns of newspapers and
      in Local Government offices. They pulled down every house in Bridge Road,
      thus breaking up some seventy presumably happy English homes, and then
      they started upon the erection of the City of Pleasure, which they
      intended to be, and which all the world now admits to be, the most
      gigantic enterprise of amusement that Europe has ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the balloon rose the general conformation of the City of Pleasure
      became visible. Running almost north and south from Hammersmith Bridge was
      the Central Way, the splendid private thoroughfare which had superseded
      Bridge Road. It was a hundred feet wide, and its surface was treated with
      westrumite, and a service of gaily coloured cable-cars flashed along it in
      either direction, between the north and the south entrances to the City.
      It was lined with multifarious buildings, all painted cream&mdash;the
      theatre, the variety theatre, the concert hall, the circus, the panorama,
      the lecture hall, the menagerie, the art gallery, the story-tellers&rsquo; hall,
      the dancing-rooms, restaurants, cafés and bars, and those numerous shops
      for the sale of useless and expensive souvenirs without which the
      happiness of no Briton on a holiday is complete. The footpaths, 20 feet
      wide, were roofed with glass, and between the footpaths and the roadway
      came two rows of trees which were industriously taking advantage of the
      weather to put forth their verdure. Footpaths and road were thronged with
      people, and the street was made gay, not only by the toilettes and
      sunshades of women, but also by processions of elephants, camels, and
      other wild-fowl, bearing children of all ages in charge of gorgeous
      Indians and Ethiops. From every roof floated great crimson flags with the
      legend in gold: &ldquo;City of Pleasure. President: Ilam; Director:
      Carpentaria.&rdquo; Add to this combined effect the music of bands and the
      sunshine, and do not forget the virgin creaminess of the elaborate
      architecture, and you will be able to form a notion of the spectacle
      offered by the esplanade upon which Ilam and Carpentaria looked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Midway between the north and south entrances, the Central Way expanded
      itself into a circular place, with a twenty-jetted bronze fountain in the
      middle. To the west was the façade of what was called the Exposition
      Palace, an enormous quadrangular building, containing a huge covered court
      which, with its balconies, would hold twenty thousand people on wet days.
      The galleries of the palace were devoted to an exhibition of everything
      that related to woman, from high-heeled shoes to thrones; it was
      astonishing how many things did relate to woman. North of the Exposition
      Palace stretched out the Amusements Park, where people looped the loop,
      shot the chute, wheeled the wheel, switched the switchback, etc.; and here
      was the balloon enclosure. South of the palace lay the Sports Fields,
      where a cricket match was progressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, and most important of all, to the east of the circular place in
      Central Way rose the impressive entrance to the Oriental Gardens, the
      pride of Ilam and Carpentaria. The Oriental Gardens occupied the entire
      eastern side of the City, and they sloped down to the Thames. They formed
      over a hundred acres of gardens, wood, and pleasaunce, laid out with
      formal magnificence. Flowers bloomed there in defiance of seasons. On
      every hand the eye was met by vistas of trees and shrubs, and by lawns and
      statues, and lakes and fountains. In the middle was Carpentaria&rsquo;s own
      special bandstand. A terrace, two thousand five. hundred feet long,
      bordered the river, and from the terrace jutted out a pier at which
      steamers were unloading visitors.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II&mdash;Interviewed
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he occupants of
      the balloon could see everything. They saw the debarcation from the
      steamers; they saw the unending crowd of doll-like persons thrown up out
      of the ground by the new Tube station at the south end of Hammersmith
      Bridge; they saw the heavy persistent stream of vehicles and pedestrians
      over the bridge; they saw the trains approaching Barnes on the
      South-Western Railway; they saw the struggles for admittance at all the
      gates of the City; they even saw flocks of people streaming Cityward along
      the Barnes High Street and the Lower Richmond Road. It was not for nothing
      that advertisements of the City of Pleasure had filled one solid page of
      every daily paper in London, and many in the provinces, for a week past.
      Visitors were now entering the city at the rate of seventy thousand an
      hour, at a shilling a head.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a gentle tug beneath the car. The thousand feet of rope had been
      paid out, and the balloon hung motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a faint noise, something between the crackling of musketry and the
      surge of waves on a pebbly beach, ascended from the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re cheering,&rdquo; said Josephus Ilam. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheering us, of course,&rdquo; answered Carpentaria excitedly. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it
      immense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immense?&rdquo; said Ilam heavily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot. What did you want to show me up
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That!&rdquo; exclaimed Carpentaria, pointing below to the city with a superb
      gesture. &ldquo;And that!&rdquo; he added passionately, pointing with another gesture
      to the whole of London, which lay spread out with all its towers and
      steeples and its blanket of smoke, tremendous and interminable to the
      east. &ldquo;That is our prey,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;our food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he began to sing the Toreador song from &ldquo;Carmen,&rdquo; exultantly launching
      the notes into the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Carpentaria,&rdquo; said Josephus Ilam, with unexpected bitterness, &ldquo;is
      this your idea of a joke? Bringing me up here to see London and our show,
      as if I didn&rsquo;t know London and our show like my pocket!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ilam&rsquo;s concealed, hatred of Carpentaria, which had been slowly growing for
      more than a year, as a fire spreads secretly in the hold of a ship, seemed
      to spurt out a swift tongue of flame in the acrimony of his tone.
      Carpentaria was startled. Even then, in a sudden flash of illumination, he
      grasped to a certain extent the import of Ilam&rsquo;s attitude towards him, but
      he did not grasp it fully. How should he?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;I believe the old johnny dislikes mel What on
      earth for?&rdquo; He could not understand all Ilam&rsquo;s reasons. &ldquo;Pity!&rdquo; he
      reflected further. &ldquo;If the managers of a show like this can&rsquo;t hit it off
      together, there may be trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In which supposition he was infinitely more right than he imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      He balanced himself lightly on the edge of the car, his left leg dangling,
      and seized one of the field-glasses which hung secured by thin steel
      chains round the inside of the wicker parapet, and putting it to his eyes,
      he gazed down at the Oriental Gardens. He must have seen something there
      that profoundly interested him, for the glasses remained glued to his eyes
      for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat,&rdquo; said Ilam firmly, standing up, &ldquo;is this your idea of a joke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was close to Carpentaria, and his glance was vicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; murmured Carpentaria, dropping the glasses. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
      matter with you is that you aren&rsquo;t an artist, not a bit of one. You are an
      excellent fellow, with a splendid head for figures, and I respect you
      enormously, but you haven&rsquo;t the artistic sense. If you had you would share
      the thrill which I feel as I survey our creation and that London over
      there. You would appreciate why I brought you up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a business man&mdash;a plain business man, that&rsquo;s what I am,&rdquo; said
      Ilam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never pretended to be an artist, and I don&rsquo;t want to be an
      artist. Let me tell you that I ought to be in the advertisement
      department, and not canoodling my time away up here, Mr. Carpentaria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said Carpentaria hastily, &ldquo;accept my apologies. Let us
      descend at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And while I&rsquo;m about it,&rdquo; pursued Ilam unheedingly&mdash;his irritation
      was like a stone rolling down a hill&mdash;&ldquo;while I&rsquo;m about it, I&rsquo;ll point
      out that your objection to having advertisements on the walls of the
      restaurants is fatuous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear Ilam,&rdquo; Carpentaria protested, &ldquo;people don&rsquo;t care to have to
      read advertisements while they&rsquo;re at their meals. It puts them off. For
      instance, to have it dinned into you that G. H. Mumm is the only champagne
      worth drinking when you happen to be drinking Heidsieck, or to have Wall&rsquo;s
      sausages thrust down your throat while you are toying with an ice-cream&mdash;people
      don&rsquo;t like it. We must think of our patrons. And, besides, it&rsquo;s so inarti&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; said Ilam. &ldquo;One way and another these ads. would be worth a
      hundred&rsquo; a week to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what&rsquo;s a hundred a week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the interest on a hundred and twenty thousand pounds,&rdquo; Ilam replied
      vivaciously. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s another thing. It would be much better if you
      employed more time in inspection instead of rehearsing and conducting your
      precious band. Any fool can conduct a band. Give me a stick and I&rsquo;d do it
      myself. But inspection&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My precious band!&rdquo; stammered Carpentaria, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      His very soul was laid low; and considering that Carpentaria&rsquo;s Band had
      been famous in the capitals of two continents for twelve years at least,
      it was not surprising that his soul should be laid low by this terrible
      phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ilam, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of it.&rdquo; His shoulder touched
      Carpentaria&rsquo;s, and his eyes&mdash;little, like a pig&rsquo;s&mdash;shot arrows
      of light. &ldquo;Supposing I shoved you over? I should have the concern to
      myself then, and no foolish interference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He twisted his face into a grim laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a sense of humour, after all, Ilam,&rdquo; responded gaily the man on
      the edge of the car, fingering his long red moustache, and he, too,
      laughed, but he got down from his perch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just like you to comprehend&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Ilam began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at that instant a head appeared above the edge of the central aperture
      of the car, and Ilam stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the head of the young man in spectacles&mdash;gold-rimmed
      spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Smithers, of the <i>Morning Herald</i>,&rdquo; said the young man brightly
      and calmly, &ldquo;and I took this opportunity of seeing you privately. Your men
      objected when I got into the parachute attachment, but you told &lsquo;em to let
      go, and so they let go. I&rsquo;ve had some difficulty in climbing up here off
      the parachute bar. Dangerous, rather. However, I&rsquo;ve done it. I dare say
      you heard the crowd cheering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it was him they were cheering,&rdquo; muttered Ilam, and then looked at
      Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilam was not a genius in the art of conversation. He could only say what
      he meant, and when the running of the City of Pleasure demanded the art of
      conversation he relied on Carpentaria, even if he was furious with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the game?&rdquo; asked Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Smithers politely, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think I deserve an interview?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know we have absolutely declined all interviews.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s why the <i>Herald</i> wants one so badly; that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m
      dangling a thousand feet above my grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria and Ilam exchanged glances. Each read the thought of the other&mdash;that
      the spectacled Smithers might have overheard their conversation, and
      should therefore be handled with care, this side up. &ldquo;Leave it to me,&rdquo;
       said the eyes of Carpentaria to the eyes of Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Smithers, of the <i>Herald</i>&rdquo;&mdash;Carpentaria blossomed into the
      flowers of speech&mdash;&ldquo;we heartily applaud your courage and your
      devotion to duty in a profession full of perils, but you are trespassing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said Smithers. &ldquo;You can only trespass on land and
      water, and this isn&rsquo;t a salmon river or a forbidden footpath. Besides,
      I&rsquo;ve got my press season-ticket. Come now, talk to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are talking to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, answer my questions, for the benefit of humanity. I&rsquo;m the father
      of a family with two penniless aunts, and the <i>Herald</i> will probably
      sack me if I fail in this interview. Think of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer not to think of it,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;However, we will answer
      any reasonable questions you care to put to us, on one condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it,&rdquo; snapped Smithers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will name it afterwards,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, looking at Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; sighed Smithers, &ldquo;I agree, whatever it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look like an honourable man. I shall trust you,&rdquo; Carpentaria
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Journalists are always honourable,&rdquo; said Smithers. &ldquo;It is their employers
      who sometimes&mdash;however, that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. You may trust
      me. Now tell me. Why this objection to interviews? That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s puzzling
      the public. You&rsquo;re a business concern, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the reason,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t a star-actor or a
      bogus company. We&rsquo;re above interviews, we are. Do you catch Smith and Son,
      or Cook&rsquo;s, or the North-Western Railway, or Mrs. Humphry Ward having
      themselves interviewed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; ejaculated Ilam glumly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People who refuse to be interviewed have a status that other people can
      never have. Our business is our business. When we want the public to know
      anything, we take a page in the <i>Herald</i>, say, and pay two hundred
      and fifty pounds for it, and inform the public exactly what we do want &rsquo;em
      to know, in our own words. We do not require the assistance of
      interviewers. There&rsquo;s the whole secret. What next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That seems pretty straight,&rdquo; Smithers agreed. &ldquo;Another thing. Why have
      you gone and called this concern the City of Pleasure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is the City of Pleasure,&rdquo; growled Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But it seems rather a fancy name, doesn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;rather too
      poetical, highfalutin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s merely because you journalists never have any imagination,&rdquo;
       Carpentaria explained. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t used to this name yet. It was you
      journalists who cried out that the Crystal Palace was a too poetical and
      highfalutin name for that glass wigwam over there&rdquo;&mdash;and he pointed to
      the twin towers of Sydenham in the distance&mdash;&ldquo;but you&rsquo;ve got used to
      it, and you admit now that it is the Crystal Palace and couldn&rsquo;t be
      anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smithers laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;All that&rsquo;s nothing. Let me come to the core of the
      apple. Do you expect this thing to pay? Do you really mean it to pay, or
      is it only a millionaire&rsquo;s lark? You know all the experts are saying it
      can&rsquo;t pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; ejaculated Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall take fifteen thousand pounds at the gates to-day,&rdquo; said
      Carpentaria. &ldquo;The highest attendance in any one day at the Paris
      Exhibition of 1900 was six hundred thousand. Do you imagine we can&rsquo;t equal
      that? We shall surpass it, sir. Wait for our August fêtes. Wait for our
      Congress of Trade Unions in September, and you will see! The average total
      attendance at the last three Paris exhibitions has been forty-five
      millions. We hope to reach fifty millions. But suppose we only reach forty
      millions. That means two million pounds in gates alone; and let me remind
      you that the minor activities of this show are self-supporting. Why, the
      Chicago Exhibition made a profit of nearly a million and a half dollars.
      Do you suppose we can&rsquo;t beat that, with a city of six million people at
      our doors, and the millions of Lancashire and Yorkshire within four hours
      of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Chicago was State-aided,&rdquo; Mr. Smithers ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;State-aided!&rdquo; cried Ilam. &ldquo;Chicago was the worst-managed show in the
      history of shows, except St. Louis. If the State came to me I should&mdash;I
      should&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Offer it a penny to go away and play in the next street.&rdquo; Carpentaria
      finished his sentence for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You interest me extremely,&rdquo; said the journalist. &ldquo;And now, as to the
      number of your employés.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He chuckled to himself with glee at the splendid interview he was getting
      out of Carpentaria and Ilam as they obligingly responded to his queries.
      It was Ilam who at last revolted, and insisted that he must descend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for my condition,&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it,&rdquo; said the journalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You asked us to talk to you and we have talked to you. The condition is
      that you regard all you have heard up here as strictly confidential&mdash;mind,
      all! You tell no one; you print nothing..Remember, you are an honourable
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is farcical,&rdquo; Smithers expostulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Carpentaria sweetly. &ldquo;Do you imagine that because you
      have an inordinate amount of cheek, a family and two penniless aunts, we
      are going to break the habits of a life-time? For myself, I have never
      been interviewed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this your last word?&rdquo; the journalist demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the journalist, and his head disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us descend,&rdquo; said Ilam, savagely pleased. And he waved the descent
      flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t descend just yet,&rdquo; the journalist informed them, popping up his
      head again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve cut the rope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria, always calm when art was not concerned, tore a fragment of
      paper from an envelope in his pocket and threw it out of the car. It sank
      away rapidly from the balloon. Moreover, it was evident, even to the eye,
      that their distance from the earth was vastly increasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I withdraw my promise now this moment,&rdquo; said the journalist, climbing
      carefully into the car. &ldquo;Everything that you say henceforward will be
      printed. We shall have quite an exciting trip. We may even get to France.
      Anyhow, I shall have a clinking column for Monday&rsquo;s <i>Herald</i>. You
      evidently hadn&rsquo;t quite appreciated what the new journalism is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there was silence in the mounting balloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilam bent his malevolent eyes longingly upon the disappearing scene below.
      The glory of the sunshine was nothing to him. He wanted to be in the
      advertisement department, arranging future contracts for spaces on the
      programmes. He reflected that it was another of the mad caprices of
      Carpentaria that had got him into this grotesque scrape. And he was so
      angry that he forgot even to think of the danger to which he was exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So here we are!&rdquo; said the journalist. &ldquo;And you can&rsquo;t do anything!&rdquo;

    <p>
      He held tightly in his hand the end of a rope, which reached up high above
      them and was lost in the mass of cordage. He had opened the valve to its
      widest.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t venture to move,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;or Mr. Ilam will break your head for
      you. This affair will cost us nothing but a few thousand cubic feet of gas
      at a half-a-crown a thousand. What it will cost you, I shall have to
      consider.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And without saying anything further for the moment, he unloosed a very
      thin cable that was wound round a windlass in the car itself, and, tying a
      white flag at the end of it, he began to lower it rapidly over the edge of
      the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to the perfect calm which reigned, the balloon was still well over
      the Amusements Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the voyagers could perceive the excited movements of the crowds
      below, and then the white flag touched earth, and was seized by the eager
      hands of the balloonists, and slowly the balloon, in a condition bordering
      on collapse, subsided to the ground with the gentleness of a fatigued
      British workman falling asleep. And great cheers, for the second time that
      day, filled the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have been sure,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, when they were ten feet off
      safety, &ldquo;that in a show like this due precautions would be taken against
      accidents and idiots!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smithers, nearly as limp as the balloon, made no reply. Josephus Ilam
      glared over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, it&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo; cried Carpentaria to the staff, who besieged
      the party with questions. &ldquo;Fill her up as quick as you can, attach the
      rope, and get ready for your public. Don&rsquo;t bother me!&rdquo; And he leapt out of
      the car and was running, literally running, away, when Ilam called out:
      &ldquo;Hi! wait a minute. What&rsquo;s to be done with this maniac here?&rdquo; And Ilam
      muttered to himself, &ldquo;Why does he run away like that? What&rsquo;s his next
      caprice going to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was forgetting,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, stopping. &ldquo;Young man&rdquo;&mdash;and he
      addressed Smithers severely&mdash;&ldquo;follow me, and no nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smithers obediently followed, pushing after Carpentaria through the
      curious crowds. They came at length to the Central Way, and Carpentaria
      halted and took Smithers by the coat collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re much too busy to trouble with police-court
      proceedings. And besides, there&rsquo;s your brace of penniless aunts. Cut!
      Clear out! Hook it! I rather admire you. See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smithers saw, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria hastened on, rushing across the Central Way, scarcely avoiding
      cable-cars, and so, by a private passage between two shops, into the
      Oriental Gardens. Now, just within the Oriental Gardens, on either side of
      the grand entrance to them, were two spacious houses, built in the
      bungalow style, with enclosed gardens of their own. One of these was
      occupied by Josephus Ilam and his mother, and the other by Carpentaria and
      his half-sister, Juliette D&rsquo;Avray. Between the house of Ilam and the back
      of the shops in Central Way was one of those small waste trifles of ground
      which often get left in planning a vast exhibition or show. It was
      skilfully hidden from the view of the public by wooden palisades, and in
      this palisading was a door, painted so as to escape detection. The plot of
      ground, about three yards by two, was already being utilized for lumber.
      Carpentaria entered by the door and shut it after him. A man&mdash;a
      middle-aged man, in a blue suit of rather shabby appearance&mdash;was
      seated on some planks. He started up, and then seemed to sway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; Carpentaria curtly demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; said the man, swaying towards Carpentaria, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m aw ri&rsquo;&mdash;you&rsquo;re
      aw ri&rsquo;&mdash;eh? I&rsquo;m a gemman. Come here to re&rsquo;&mdash;rest. You leave me
      &rsquo;lone&mdash;I leave you &rsquo;lone. Stop, I give you my car&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man was obviously inebriated and Carpentaria was in no mood to spend
      precious minutes in diplomacy with a victim of Bacchus. He departed,
      shutting the door, and leaving the victim fumbling with a card-case. He
      meant to send some one to eject the man, but he forgot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say!&rdquo; cried the drunkard after him, &ldquo;how ju know I wazz &rsquo;ere? Mus&rsquo;
      been up in a b&rsquo;loon&mdash;I repea&rsquo;&mdash;b&rsquo;loon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In another moment Carpentaria was in the study of his bungalow, panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; he said to Juliette, an extremely natty little woman of thirty or
      so.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sank into the chair before his desk. Juliette placed some music-paper
      in front of him and put a pen in his hand, and he scrawled across the top
      of the page &ldquo;The Balloon Lullaby,&rdquo; and began to scribble notes&mdash;quavers,
      crotchets, semibreves, and some other strange wonders&mdash;all over the
      page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It came to me all of a sudden,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;while we were up in the
      balloon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk, dear,&rdquo; said Juliette. &ldquo;Write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was finished Carpentaria wiped his brow and drank a whisky and
      milk which Juliette had prepared for him. He sighed with content and
      exhaustion. The creative crisis was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play it,&rdquo; he ejaculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Juliette sat down at the piano near the window overlooking the
      magnificent gardens, and played softly the two hundred and forty-seventh&rsquo;
      <i>opus</i> of Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is lovely,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a classy little thing. Came to me just like
      that!&rdquo; He snapped his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your best ones always do,&rdquo; Juliette smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have that performed this very night,&rdquo; he stated.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV&mdash;Mrs. Ilam
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>omewhat later on
      the same afternoon, in the drawing-room of the house opposite, Josephus
      Ilam was drinking tea with his mother. The aged Mrs. Ilam, who was very
      thin and not in the least tall&mdash;her son would have made a dozen of
      her&mdash;sat tremendously upright in her chair, while Josephus lolled his
      great bulk in angry attitudes on a sofa, near which the tea-table had been
      placed. Mrs. Ilam wore widow&rsquo;s weeds, though it was many years since she
      had lost her husband, a man who had made a vast fortune out of soda-water&mdash;in
      the days when soda-water <i>was</i> soda-water. She had a narrow, hard
      face, with intensely black eyes, and intensely white hair, and when she
      directed those eyes upon her son, it became instantly plain that her son
      was at once her idol and her slave. She lived solely for this man of
      fifty, who had scarcely ever left her side. For her this mass of fifteen
      stone four was still a young child, needing watchful care and constant
      advice. Certainly she spoilt him; but, just as certainly, he went in awe
      of her. The fact that by judicious investments in hotel and public-house
      property he had more than doubled the fortune which his father left, did
      not at all improve his standing with the antique dame; it only made him in
      her view a clever boy with financial leanings. Moreover, every penny of
      the Ilam fortune was legally hers during her lifetime. Even Ilam&rsquo;s share
      in the City of Pleasure was hers. When Carpentaria had discovered him, he
      had had to decide whether or not he should put more than a million pounds
      into the enterprise, and it was his mother who decided, who listened to
      everything, and then briefly told him that he would be a fool to leave the
      thing alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, in her high quavering voice, as she passed him a cup of
      tea&mdash;the cup rattled on the saucer in her blue-veined parchment hand&mdash;&ldquo;so
      you are not getting on with Carpentaria? I was afraid you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t listen to reason about the advertisements,&rdquo; said Ilam crossly,
      stirring his tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s absolutely mad about his music. He&rsquo;s spent ten hours in
      rehearsing these last two days. All the work, I&rsquo;ve had to do myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, to crown his exploits, he takes me up in the balloon, mother&mdash;wastes
      a solid hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the balloon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ilam recounted the incident of the balloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, after all, he lets that impudent journalist go free&mdash;absolutely
      free!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jos,&rdquo; said his mother, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a wonder you&rsquo;re alive, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity Carpentaria&rsquo;s alive,&rdquo; rejoined Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother&rsquo;s burning eyes met his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;ve been thinking,&rdquo; she piped calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her son&rsquo;s gaze dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you began grumbling about him, last week but one, my pet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s no use now,&rdquo; Ilam grumbled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve carried out all his ideas, and
      it&rsquo;s simply a matter of business, and Carpentaria doesn&rsquo;t know the meaning
      of the word &lsquo;business.&rsquo; Just think of his argument about those ads.!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that, Jos,&rdquo; Mrs. Ilam put in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only in the way now,&rdquo; Jos proceeded gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he wouldn&rsquo;t retire,&rdquo; Mrs. Ilam suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Retire? Of course he wouldn&rsquo;t retire&mdash;nothing would induce him to
      retire. He enjoys it&mdash;he enjoys annoying me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have the satisfaction of a very great
      success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked out of the window at the gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; growled Ilam. &ldquo;And he gets half the profits. I&rsquo;ve found all the
      money, and he hasn&rsquo;t found a cent. But he gets half the profits. What for?
      A few ideas&mdash;nothing else. He pretends to direct, but he&rsquo;ll direct
      nothing except his blessed band. And I reckon we shall clear a profit of
      ten thousand a week! Half of ten is five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He only gets half the profits as long as he lives, Jos,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ilam.
      &ldquo;After that&mdash;nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; agreed Jos, biting cruelly into a hot scone. &ldquo;But as long as he
      lives he&rsquo;s costing me, say, five thousand a week, besides worry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He mayn&rsquo;t live long,&rdquo; Mrs. Ilam ventured. &ldquo;No, but he may live
      fifty-years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposing he died very suddenly, Jos,&rdquo; Mrs. Ilam pursued calmly; &ldquo;he
      wouldn&rsquo;t be the first person that was inconvenient to you who had
      disappeared unexpectedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; Ilam almost shouted, starting up. &ldquo;But would he?&rdquo; Mrs. Ilam
      persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; muttered Josephus, and his voice trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ilam blew out the spirit-lamp under the kettle as though she was
      blowing out Carpentaria. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off,&rdquo; said Josephus nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment, child. Ring the bell for me.&rdquo; A servant entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring me your master&rsquo;s knitted waistcoat,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, mother, I shan&rsquo;t want it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you will, Jos. There&rsquo;s no month more treacherous than May. You&rsquo;ll
      put it on to please me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed, bent down to kiss his terrible parent, and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think it over,&rdquo; she called out after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilam stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, what about his sister?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mix up two quite
      separate things,&rdquo; Mrs. Ilam responded. &ldquo;Besides, she isn&rsquo;t his sister.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER V&mdash;The Band
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hat night the City
      of Pleasure was illuminated. Eighty thousand tiny electric lamps hanging
      in festoons from standard to standard lighted the Central Way alone; the
      façades of all the places of amusement were outlined in fire; the shops
      glittered; and the cable-cars, as they flashed to and fro, bore the
      monogram I.C. in electricity on their foreheads. At eight o&rsquo;clock the
      thoroughfare was crowded with visitors, and the stream of arrivals was
      stronger than ever. In the superb restaurants, at all prices (no matter
      what the price, they were equally superb in decoration), five thousand
      diners were finishing five thousand dinners, their eyes undisturbed by the
      presence of advertisements on the walls. The theatre, the music-hall, the
      circus, the menagerie, the concerts, and the rest of the entertainments,
      were filling up. In the Amusements Park people shot down railways into
      water, slid down smooth slopes into mattresses, circled in great wheels,
      floated in the latest novelties of merry-go-rounds, ascended in the
      balloon, and practised all the other devices for frittering away eternity,
      just as though night had not fallen. In the vast court of the Exposition
      Palace a band was swelling the strains of the newest waltzes to three
      storeys of loungers and sitters at café-tables, while within the interior
      of the building men and women wandered about examining the multifarious
      attractions of the Woman&rsquo;s Exhibition.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the chief joy was the Oriental Gardens, wherein a multitude of over
      fifty thousand persons had gathered together. The Oriental Gardens were
      illuminated, but in a different manner from the Central Way. Chinese
      lanterns were suspended everywhere in the budding trees, giving the
      illusion of magic precocious flowers that had blossomed there in a single
      hour, in all the tints of the rainbow and many others entirely foreign to
      the rainbow. The bandstand alone was picked out in electricity. It blazed
      in the centre of the gardens like a giant&rsquo;s crown, and, although yet
      empty, it formed the main object of attention. Overhead stretched a
      dark-blue sky, silvered with stars, and the wind had a warm and caressing
      quality which encouraged sightseers to expose themselves to it to such an
      extent that the fifteen cafés of the Oriental Gardens, some sheltered,
      some quite open, but each a centre of light and laughter, were every one
      crowded with guests. The four thousand chairs surrounding the bandstand
      were occupied, and also the six thousand other chairs dispersed in various
      parts of the gardens. The murmur of conversation, the rustle of dresses,
      the tinkle of glasses, the rumour of uncountable footsteps, rose on the
      air. The faces of pretty women could be observed obscurely in the
      delicious gloom, and the glowing scarlet of cigars bobbed mysteriously
      about like aspecies of restless glow-worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      And everybody was conscious of the sensation of the extraordinary and
      amazing success of the great show. The evening papers had carried the news
      of the wonderful thing to each suburb of London. These papers gave from
      hour to hour the number of the persons who had passed the turnstiles, and
      calculated the number of tons of shillings that Ilam and Carpentaria would
      have to bank on Monday morning. But the principal thing that struck the
      evening papers was the complete readiness of the City of Pleasure. No
      detail of it was unfinished, and all agreed that this phenomenon stood
      unique in the history of the art of amusing immense crowds. All felt that
      a new era of amusement enterprise had been ushered in by Ilam and
      Carpentaria, that everything was changed, and that in the future an
      enlightened and excessively exacting public would not be satisfied with
      what had pleased it in the past. And the owners of the old-fashioned
      resorts trembled in their shoes, and hated Ilam and Carpentaria, while the
      myriad patrons of Ilam and Carpentaria on that first day flattered
      themselves that they had personally assisted at the birth of the grand
      innovation, and thought how they would say to their grandchildren: &ldquo;Yes, I
      was present at the opening of the City of Pleasure, and a marvellous
      affair it was,&rdquo; and so on, in the manner of grandparents.
    </p>
    <p>
      All were expecting Carpentaria, the lion of the show.
    </p>
    <p>
      His band was due to perform from eight o&rsquo;clock to ten, and special bills,
      posted on the sides of the gilded bandstand and in the cafés, announced:
      &ldquo;Carpentaria&rsquo;s band will play the Balloon Lullaby, the latest composition
      of Carpentaria, composed this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At ten minutes before eight the members of the band, sixty in number, and
      clad in the imperial purple uniform, marched in Indian file across the
      gardens to the stand. At a distance of ten paces from the end of the
      procession came Carpentaria, preceded by a small page bearing his baton on
      a cushion of purple velvet. Carpentaria always did things with
      overwhelming style and solemnity. Superior persons laughed at the style
      and solemnity, but the vast majority did not laugh; they cheered; they
      appreciated. Whether they were right or wrong, the indubitable fact is
      that these things came naturally to Carpentaria; they were the expression
      of his exceedingly theatrical soul, the devices of a man who believes in
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o&rsquo;clock precisely Carpentaria faced the fifty thousand from his
      bandstand, and, after having bowed elaborately thrice, turned to the band,
      and lifted the sacred stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a dramatic moment, the real inauguration of the City of Pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheers and hurrahs rolled in terrific volumes of sound across the gardens,
      and they did not cease; and people not acquainted with the fame and renown
      of Carpentaria perceived what it was to be a favourite of capitals, a
      leading star in the galaxy of stars that the public salutes and
      recognizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria preserved the immobility of carven stone until the plaudits
      had ceased; they lasted for exactly five and a half minutes. Consequently
      the concert was exactly five and a half minutes late in commencing.
      Carpentaria himself was never late, but his public had a habit of delaying
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he brought rown his baton with a surprising shock. The carven
      stone had started into life, and &ldquo;God save the King&rdquo; was under way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now to see Carpentaria conduct was one of the sights of the world. He
      conducted not merely with his hand and eye, but with the whole of his
      immortal frame and his uniform. It was said that he was capable of
      conducting the Eroica Symphony of Beethoven with his left foot&mdash;and
      who shall deny it? &ldquo;God save the King&rdquo; was child&rsquo;s play to him. Moreover,
      he showed a certain reserve in handling it. He merely conducted it as
      though in conducting it he himself were literally saving the King. That
      was all. But with what snap, what dash, what <i>chic</i>, what splash and
      what magnificent presence of mind did he save the King! The applause was
      wild and ample.

      The next item was &ldquo;The City of Pleasure March,&rdquo; composed by Carpentaria.
      Indeed, Carpentaria conducted nothing but national hymns, his own
      compositions, and, as a superlative concession, Wagner and Beethoven. &ldquo;The
      City of Pleasure&rdquo; was in Carpentaria&rsquo;s finest style, and it was planned to
      give him the fullest scope in conducting it. He had already made it famous
      in a triumphal tour through the United States in the previous year. It
      began with the utmost possible volume of sound. It had a contagious and
      infectious lilt to it, and both the lilt and the volume of sound were
      continued without the slightest respite during the whole composition. In
      the course of this masterpiece Carpentaria performed physical feats that
      would have astounded Cinquevalli and the Schaffer Troupe. In the frenzy of
      self-expression he all but stood on his head. The bandstand was too small
      for him; he needed a planet on which to circulate. By turns his baton was
      a sceptre, a pump-handle, a maypole, a crutch, a drumstick, a flag, a
      toothpick, a mop, a pendulum, a whip, a bottle of soothing-syrup, and a
      scorpion. By turns he whipped, tortured, encouraged, liberated,
      imprisoned, mopped up, measured, governed, diverted, pushed over, pulled
      back, and turned inside out his band, and whenever their enthusiasm seemed
      likely to lead them into indiscretions, he soothed them with the
      soothing-syrup. By turns the conducting of the piece was a march, a
      campaign, a house on fire, the race for the Derby, the forging of a
      hundred-ton gun, a display of fireworks, a mayoral banquet, and a mother
      scolding a numerous family.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was colossal.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close, as sudden as the shutting of a door, there was a vast
      strange silence, and then the applause, as colossal as the piece, broke
      out like a conflagration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria bowed; the entire band bowed; Carpentaria bowed again. Lastly
      he indicated a flute-player with his baton, and the flute-player came
      forward and shared the glory of Carpentaria. Why a flute-player, no one
      could have guessed. Forty flutes could not have been heard in that
      terrific concourse of brass and drums. But Carpentaria was Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did any of you hear the sound of a shot?&rdquo; Carpentaria said in a low voice
      to his band.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shot? No, sir. No, sir,&rdquo; came from a dozen mouths. &ldquo;Why, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because a bullet has just grazed my ear. It was in the fourth bar from
      the end.&rdquo; He put his hand to his ear and showed blood on his finger. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      nothing, nothing,&rdquo; he quieted them. &ldquo;I shall expect you to behave as
      though nothing had occurred, as soldiers in fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; replied the intrepid band.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria gazed at one of the iron supports of the roof of the
      bandstand. In a line with his head the surface of the pillar had been
      damaged and dented. He disturbed two trombone-players in order to search
      the floor, and in a few seconds he had found a flattened bullet, which he
      put in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Number two,&rdquo; he said sharply, going to his desk and tapping it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Number two was the lullaby. No more striking contrast to the march could
      have been found. It was so delicate, so softly stealing, that you could
      scarcely hear it; and yet you could hear it&mdash;you could hear it
      everywhere. Carpentaria drew sweetness out of his band with the gestures
      of a conjurer drawing an interminable roll of coloured paper from his
      mouth, previously shown to be empty. It was the daintiest thing, swaying
      in the air like gossamer. It brought tears to the orbs of mothers, and
      made strong men close their eyes. Such was the versatility of Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applause amounted to a furore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you my word of honour, ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; said Carpentaria,
      coming to the rail of the stand and stilling the cheers with a gesture,
      &ldquo;at halfpast three this afternoon not a note of the little piece was
      composed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His demeanour gave no sign of agitation. But at the close of the concert,
      no more bullets having arrived, he wiped his brow with relief. Most of the
      band did the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked about on the river terrace for over an hour, calming his spirit,
      which had been through so many excitements, artistic and otherwise, during
      the afternoon and evening. And he meditated, now on the bullet, and now on
      Ilam. He could scarcely realize how nearly he had escaped quarrelling with
      Ilam in the balloon; their relations hitherto had been invariably
      amicable, at any rate on the surface; and he had done so much for Ilam; he
      had put a second fortune in Ilam&rsquo;s pocket. The dazzling success of the day
      of inauguration was the success of Carpentaria&rsquo;s ideas. And yet Ilam hated
      him. He felt that Ilam hated him. He almost shuddered as he remembered the
      moment when he had sat on the dizzy edge of the balloon-car, and Ilam had
      threatened him, and then laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Oriental Gardens were empty and dark. The gay crowd had departed; the
      lights were extinguished. Only the light in Ilam&rsquo;s drawing-room shone
      across the expanse as it had shone through all the evening. Carpentaria&rsquo;s
      own bungalow was dark. He wondered what Juliette was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he set off home through the gardens. And just as he was entering
      his front-door he recollected that he had given no instructions about the
      drunken man in the enclosure. He turned back down the steps, and went into
      the enclosure and struck a match. The man was lying on the ground, no
      doubt asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is a caution!&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A notion occurred to him, one of his fanciful pranks. He picked up the
      unconscious man, who held himself stiff and did not even groan, and
      carried him, not with too much difficulty&mdash;for Carpentaria was
      extremely powerful&mdash;to the side-door of Ilam&rsquo;s residence; he placed
      the form against the door. Every night for weeks past Ilam had come out by
      that door about midnight to take a final stroll of inspection. He felt
      that he owed Ilam a grudge. Then he retired into the shadow and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the door opened, and Ilam fell over the man, as Carpentaria
      hoped he would, and picked himself up with oaths and struck a match and
      gazed at the form.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same instant a woman&rsquo;s figure passed Carpentaria in the dark. He
      was surprised to recognize Juliette. He touched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried softly, starting back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you start like that?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;frightened me,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He escorted her into their house. When he came out again Ilam was
      descending the steps by the side door. Nothing lay near the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seen anything of a drunken man?&rdquo; Carpentaria called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ilam, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not near your door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing. Only I thought I saw one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; growled Ilam, but instead of taking the air he returned
      abruptly to the house.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI&mdash;The Black Burden
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>urious!
      Carpentaria meditated as he retired to his abode. &ldquo;Having fallen over a
      man lying drunk on his steps, why should my friend and partner, Mr.
      Josephus Ilam, totally deny that he has seen a drunken man? With my own
      eyes I saw him tumble. Now this mishap must have made Mr. Josephus Ilam
      angry, because he is just the sort of person who does get angry upon the
      provocation of a pure accident. Yet, so far as I could judge in the gloom,
      there was no trace of anger in his demeanour when he answered my question.
      On the contrary, he appeared to be rather subdued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And further&mdash;what has become of my friend the drunken man? The
      drunken man must exist somewhere. Is he in Ilam&rsquo;s house? And, if so, why
      is he in Ilam&rsquo;s house? Neither Josephus nor his mother is precisely a type
      of the Good Samaritan. And if he is not in Ilam&rsquo;s house, has he suddenly
      recovered and walked away on his legs unaided? Impossible! I was once
      drunk, and I say, impossible. Then, has Josephus carried him somewhere?
      And where has he carried him, and why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria unlocked his front-door and entered the hall of his dwelling,
      and then locked and bolted the door. He was not in the habit of either
      locking or bolting his front-door; the idea of so securing a house which
      stood in the middle of half a square mile of private property, well
      guarded at all its gates, seemed ridiculous. Nevertheless he did it, and
      he could have given no reason for doing it. He imagined that he heard
      footsteps in the passage leading from the hall to the kitchen, and he
      quickly turned on the electric light and looked down the passage. But
      there was nothing. He decided that he was very nervous and impressionable
      that night. The servants had, doubtless, long since gone to bed. He
      extinguished the light and made his way upstairs to his study, and sat
      down in his chair&mdash;the famous chair in which he composed his famous
      melodies. The faint illumination of the May night made the principal
      objects in the room vaguely visible. He could discern the pale square of
      the framed autograph letter from President McKinley which hung on the
      opposite wall. He tried to collect his ideas and think in a logical
      sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, again, he fancied that he heard footsteps, and that he saw a dim
      form near the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he cried sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only me,&rdquo; answered a woman&rsquo;s voice, and the electricity was at the
      same instant switched on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juliette stood there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you sitting in the dark, Carlos?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carlos was her pet name for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said lamely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor dear,&rdquo; she smiled, approaching him. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said good-night to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her long and elegant hands on his shoulders, as was her wont each
      evening, and kissed him on both cheeks in her French fashion. The
      affection between Carlos and his half-French half-sister was real and
      profound. He liked her for her Parisian daintiness, and for the eminently
      practical qualities which she possessed in common with most Frenchwomen,
      and also because she regarded him as a genius. To-night he thought she was
      sweeter and more sisterly than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; she said, and her voice trembled, and a slight humidity
      glistened in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; he responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she tripped off, swinging the perfect skirt of her black <i>mousseline</i>
      dress round the edge of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s mightily excited to-night,&rdquo; he murmured to himself; and he
      reflected, as all men reflect from time to time, that women are strange
      and incomprehensible, a device invented by Providence to keep the wit of
      man well sharpened by constant employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed into his bedroom, and went out on to the wooden balcony of the
      bedroom, which commanded a view of Ilam&rsquo;s side-door. A light showed
      through the glass above the door, and Carpentaria noticed at length that
      the door was slightly ajar. He stepped back into the bedroom, extinguished
      all his own lights, and returned to the balcony to watch. He determined to
      watch as long as Ilam&rsquo;s door remained ajar. He sat down in a cane chair
      provided for repose on the balcony, and his one regret was that the glow
      of a cigarette or a cigar would betray him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grew calmer. The frenzy into which music always threw him had quite
      worn itself away. He was able to think clearly. He did not, however, think
      so much upon the incident of the drunken man as upon the incident of the
      bullet; and this was perhaps natural. He was astounded now that he could
      have remained in the bandstand, so utterly careless of danger, after the
      arrival of the bullet. He was astounded, too, at the sang-froid of his
      musicians. But, then, their ears had not been grazed, and his had. He saw
      that he was at the mercy of any homicidal maniac who, on a dark night,
      with a good rifle and a sure aim, chose to secrete himself in some
      deserted alley of the vast Oriental Gardens, and shoot at him during a
      loud burst of music. And he said: &ldquo;Well, if I am to die, I am to die, and
      there&rsquo;s an end of it. Assuming that a given man A has really determined to
      kill another given man B, and A is obstinate, nothing will ultimately save
      B. I am B. Hence I must be philosophical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But who was A?
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought of all the enemies he had made, all the rivals he had defeated,
      but the process of their enumeration was perfunctory. For out of the
      depths of his mind rose persistently one name, again, and again, and
      again, and yet again, like a succession of bubbles, all alike, rising to
      the surface of a pond and breaking there. And that name was the name of
      Ilam. He forbade the name to rise, but it rose. With the simplicity which
      marked some of his mental processes, he could not understand why Ilam
      should hate him murderously. But the episode of the balloon had magically
      and terribly cast a new and searching light on the recesses of Ham&rsquo;s
      character. He felt that hitherto he had been mistaken in Ilam, and that
      Ilam was not a person with whom it was wise to have interests in common.
      And the unknown designs of Ilam seemed to surround him in the night like
      the web of a gigantic spider, and to bind him tighter and tighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his reflections were interrupted by a sound somewhere below the
      balcony.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the sound of his own side-door being very cautiously opened. He
      could hear it perfectly clearly in the still night; but whether the door
      was being opened from the outside or the inside he could not tell. He
      remembered that, though he had bolted and locked the front-door, he had
      utterly forgotten the side-door. He leaned over the balcony as far as he
      dared, but even so he could catch no glimpse of anything in the obscurity
      beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there were steps on the gravel, and he saw a white blur moving on
      the top of a dark mass. In another moment he perceived that the apparition
      was Juliette, with a white shawl wrapped round her head. What was she
      doing there, and why had she opened the door so cautiously? Had she some
      secret? He decided to watch her. She moved to the middle of the avenue
      between the two houses and hesitated. And then the great clock in the
      tower of the Exposition Palace tolled the hour of twelve solemnly, as it
      were warningly, over the immense extent of the sleeping City of Pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appeal of the clock seemed to Carpentaria to be almost dramatic. He
      felt strongly that he could not spy upon Juliette, that he could not be
      disloyal to this affectionate companion of his life, and honourably he
      called out to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juliette, what are you doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His own voice startled him. It was so clear and penetrative in the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a slight pause. Then Juliette replied: &ldquo;Carlos, you seem bent on
      frightening me tonight. I thought you were in bed and asleep. You&rsquo;ll take
      cold on that balcony. I only came out to get a little air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The notion struck him that her head was turned directly to Ham&rsquo;s house,
      and yet she made no comment on the light there and the door ajar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go in, there&rsquo;s a good girl,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you who&rsquo;ll be taking
      cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going in,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had yet another alarm. Something moved on the balcony itself, near a
      row of flower-pots. Then he felt a pressure against his leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Beppo!&rdquo; he whispered, suddenly relieved, smiling at his nervous
      timidity. A great Angora cat leaped on to his knees, and began clawing at
      the superb pile of his purple trousers. He stroked the animal, and Beppo
      purred with a volume of sound equal to that of many sawmills. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t purr
      so loud, Bep,&rdquo; he advised the cat; but the cat, under the impression that
      it was the centre of importance in the best of all possible worlds, purred
      with undiminished vigour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour passed so, and then
      Carpentaria heard heavy footsteps in the avenue from the direction of the
      Central Way. He jumped up, shattering the illusions of Beppo, and listened
      intently. A man presently appeared, walking slowly. He wondered who it
      could be; but when the figure paused at Ilam&rsquo;s steps, mounted them, and
      pushed open the unlatched door, he saw that it was Ilam himself, and that
      Ilam was holding in his arms a bundle of what looked like black cloth. The
      vision of him was but transient, for Ilam closed the door at once. Ilam,
      then, must have left his house before Carpentaria had come on to the
      balcony. The watcher on the balcony felt his heart beating rapidly. His
      calm had vanished. The frenzy of the music, the perturbation caused by the
      bullet, had passed, only to give way to another and perhaps a more
      dreadful excitation. What could these secret journeys of Ilam portend? He
      clutched fiercely the rail of the balcony in his apprehensive anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time&mdash;not a very long time&mdash;the door opened again, and
      for at least five seconds Josephus Ilam stood plainly silhouetted against
      a light within the house, and over his shoulders, which were bent, he
      carried an enormous limp burden, draped in black. He looked back into the
      house once, then turned awkwardly, because of his burden, to shut the door
      behind him, and with excessive deliberation descended the steps and came
      out into the avenue. The figure and its burden were now nothing but a
      shape in the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria decided in the fraction of a second what he would do. He
      slipped into his bedroom, took off his boots, put on a pair of felt
      slippers, scurried downstairs, opened the side-door, and gently slipped
      out. Ilam, tramping slowly with clumsy footsteps, had reached the arch
      leading to the Central Way.

      CHAPTER VII&mdash;The Cut
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>arpentaria dogged
      him with all the precautions of silence as he turned to the right down the
      Central Way. The great thoroughfare of the City of Pleasure was, of
      course, absolutely deserted. Its fountains were stilled; its pretty
      cable-cars had disappeared; its flags had been hauled down. The meagre
      trees rustled chilly in the night-wind. Its vast and floriated white
      architecture seemed under the sombre sky to be the architecture of a
      dream. The one sign of human things was the illuminated face of the clock
      over the Exposition Palace, which showed twenty-five minutes past twelve.
      Of the two thousand souls employed in the City, more than half had gone to
      their homes in the other city, London, and several hundreds slept in the
      dormitories that had been built for them at the southern extremity of the
      Central Way. The remaining hundred or so were dispersed in various parts
      of the City, either watching or asleep. Some had the right to sleep at
      their posts. But the men of the highly-organized fire service would be
      awake and alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet there happened to be no living creature on the Way, except its two
      chiefs. Ilam crossed the Way, and turned off it through an avenue that lay
      between the lecture hall and the menagerie. Carpentaria followed at a safe
      distance, hiding in the thick shadows as he went. From the interior of the
      menagerie came the subdued growls and groans of the wild beasts therein,
      suffering from insomnia, and longing for the jungle. Among the treasures
      of the menagerie was a society of twenty-seven lions, who went through a
      performance twice a day under their trainer, Brant, the king of
      lion-tamers, as he was called on the City of Pleasure programmes, and as
      he, in fact, was. There were also a celebrated sanguinary tiger, that had
      killed three men in New York, and various other delicate attractions. The
      nocturnal noises of these fearsome animals were sufficiently appalling.
      And when Ilam stopped before a little door in the south façade of the
      menagerie building, a cold perspiration froze the forehead and the spirit
      of Carpentaria. Was the man going to yield his mysterious black-enveloped
      burden to the lions and the tigers, the jackals and the hyenas, of that
      inestimable collection of African and Asiatic fauna?
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ilam struggled onwards. And next they passed the electricity works,
      which was in full activity, for the manufacture of light went on night and
      day in the City of Pleasure. Ilam slunk along the front of the workshops,
      increasing his pace. Fortunately for him, the windows were seven feet from
      the ground, so that he could not be observed from within. The whirr of the
      wheels revolving incessantly in front of gigantic magnets filled the air,
      and from the high windows shone a steely-blue radiance, chequered by the
      flying shadows of machinery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilam turned again, and entered the Amusements Park, and, threading his way
      among chutes, switchbacks, slides, and ponds, he crossed it from end to
      end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he going?&rdquo; Carpentaria muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, suddenly, it occurred to Carpentaria where Ilam was going.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the Amusements Park, and abutting on the confines of the City
      territory, was a large waste piece of ground which had been used for
      excavations and for refuse. In the tremendous operation of levelling the
      site of the City, digging foundations, and gardening in the landscape
      manner, much earth had been needed in one spot, and much earth had had to
      be removed in another. The waste piece of ground was the clearing-house of
      this business. In certain parts it was humped like a camel&rsquo;s back, and in
      others it was hollowed into pits. Immense quantities of soil lay loose,
      and there were, besides, barrows and spades in abundance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived in the midst of this sterile wilderness, Ilam unceremoniously
      dropped his burden near a miniature mountain, which raised itself by the
      side of a miniature pit. He then found a spade, and, having tested the
      looseness of the soil, took up the black mystery and slipped it carefully
      into the pit. Then he climbed with the spade on to the summit of the
      hillock, and began to push the soil from the hillock into the pit. It
      proved to be the simplest thing in the world. In five minutes the burden
      of Ilam lay under several feet of soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria, favoured by the nature of the spot, had crept closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust!&rdquo; he heard Ilam reciting.
      Amazing phenomenon! But nothing can be more amazing than the behaviour of
      an utterly respectable man when he is committing a crime!
    </p>
    <p>
      The affair finished, Ilam departed, passing within a few feet of
      Carpentaria, who stretched himself flat on the ground to avoid detection.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Ilam had vanished out of sight, Carpentaria jumped up feverishly,
      seized the spade, leapt into the pit and began to dig&mdash;to dig with a
      fury of haste. Fate helped him, for the black mass was uncovered in less
      time than had been taken to cover it. He dragged it slowly out of the pit,
      and slowly, almost reluctantly, unwrapped it. He had been sure at the
      first touch that it was the body of a man, and he was not mistaken. In the
      gloomy night he could see the white patches made by the face and the
      hands. The body was not yet stiff. He hesitated, and then struck a match.
      He hoped the wind would blow it out, but the wind spared it; it flared
      bravely, and lighted the face of the corpse, and the corpse was that of
      the mysterious drunken man.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand unanswerable questions fought together for solution in
      Carpentaria&rsquo;s brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew himself to be in the presence of a crime, of a murder. His legal
      duty, therefore, was to fetch justice in the shape of a policeman. But he
      reflected that no battalion of policemen and judges could undo the crime,
      bring the dead to life, make innocent the guilty. He reflected also upon
      the clumsiness of State justice, and the inconveniences attaching to it,
      and upon the immeasurable harm its advent might do to the opening season
      of the City of Pleasure. Moreover, he had a horror of capital punishment,
      and he was a bold and original man, though an artist. He settled rapidly
      in his mind that he himself would probe the matter to its root, and that
      the justice involved should be the private justice of Carpentaria, not the
      public justice of the realm.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a few minutes later he had discovered a long, flat barrow, and was
      wheeling away the burden that had bent the back of Josephus Ilam. He
      brought it circuitously and gently by way of the Sports Fields round again
      to the Central Way, and so to the neighbourhood of his own house. The
      night had now grown darker than ever, and a few drops of rain began to
      fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, as he was approaching the two bungalows, he stopped and
      listened. He thought he heard footsteps; but no sound met his ear, and he
      raised the handles of the barrow again. By this time he was midway between
      the bungalows and about to turn to the side-entrance of his own. Once more
      he stopped; he distinctly did hear footsteps crushing the gravel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that? Anyone there?&rdquo; cried a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was Ilam&rsquo;s voice, full of fear. Carpentaria crept away to the
      shelter of his own wall, leaving the barrow that had become a bier in the
      midst of the path. Vaguely and dimly he saw the form of Ilam coming down
      the avenue, saw it stop uncertainly before the barrow, saw it bend down,
      and then he heard a shriek&mdash;a shriek of terror&mdash;loud, violent,
      and echoing, and Ilam fled away. Carpentaria heard him mount the steps of
      his house and fumble with the door, and then he heard the bang of the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all possible speed he rushed to the barrow, wheeled it into his
      garden, and thence to an outhouse, of which he carefully fastened the
      padlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood some time hesitant in the avenue, wondering whether any further
      singular phenomenon would proceed from the Ilam house that night. His
      curiosity was rewarded. A most strange procession emerged presently from
      the bungalow. First came old Mrs. Ilam, dressed in a crimson
      dressing-gown, a white nightcap on her head, and carrying a lamp with an
      elaborate drawing-room shade. Carpentaria could see that the lamp shook in
      her trembling hand. Her hands always trembled, but her head never. She
      came down the steps with the deliberation of extreme old age, peering in
      front of her, and she was followed, timorously, by her son. The lamp threw
      a large circle of yellow light on the ground, and at intervals Mrs. Ilam
      held it up high so that it illuminated the faces of mother and son. They
      came into the middle of the avenue. It was now seriously raining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t be there,&rdquo; Ilam whispered, in an awed tone. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
      the sort of thing that stays. But I saw it&mdash;I saw the cloth and I saw
      a bit of its face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ilam looked about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Jos,&rdquo; she upbraided him, fixing her eyes on him in a sort of
      reproof. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your imagination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Josephus. &ldquo;I saw it; and what&rsquo;s more, it was on a bier.
      That&rsquo;s the worst&mdash;it was on a bier. Mother, he will haunt me all my
      life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so loud, child,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Ilam. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of going to bed?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;What! I took him and I
      buried him as safe as houses. I left him there, and I came straight back
      here, except that I was stopped by a watchman at the stables, who told me
      the horses seemed to be all frightened. And I had a talk to the fellow;
      and I find <i>it</i> on a bier here, right in my path. And now it&rsquo;s gone
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why were the horses frightened? That shows&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; Mrs. Ilam repeated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you some hot milk, and you must
      try to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Mother, you mustn&rsquo;t leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the procession re-entered the house, and the door was closed, but a
      light burned upstairs through the remainder of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria himself had little sleep; he scarcely tried to sleep. He arose
      at seven o&rsquo;clock, and dressed and went out on to the balcony. The rain had
      ceased, and the Sunday morning was exquisitely calm and sunny. The whole
      scene was so bright and clear that the events of six hours ago appeared
      fantastic and impossible. Yet Carpentaria knew only too well that the
      unidentified corpse lay in the outhouse. He meant first to examine the
      corpse himself, and then to confide in a certain official of the city whom
      he knew that he could trust. What he should do after that he could not
      imagine. Decidely some process of burial would be speedily imperative.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the blinds of the Ilam bungalow were drawn. He guessed that at least
      the upper ones would remain so, and he was somewhat taken aback when Mrs.
      Ilam herself appeared at a window and opened it. He was still more taken
      aback to see Mrs. Ilam a moment later open the door, and with much
      stateliness cross the avenue to his own dwelling. He knew that she was
      friendly with Juliette, and that Juliette liked her. He, too, had admired
      her, but only because she was so old and so masterful, such a surprising
      relic. That she should be accessory to a crime did not seem strange to
      him. He esteemed her to be a woman capable of anything. He would have to
      warn Juliette.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o&rsquo;clock a servant brought up the French breakfast with which,
      under Juliette&rsquo;s influence, he compromised with hunger till lunch-time;
      and with the breakfast came, as usual, the cat Beppo. The breakfast
      consisted of a two-handled bowl of milk and a fresh roll and a pat of
      butter. Beppo seemed determined to share the breakfast without delay.
      Carpentaria, as was his frequent practice, took the roll off its plate and
      poured on the plate as much milk as it would hold. And Beppo, to whom milk
      was the answer to the riddle of the universe, leapt on to the table and
      began to lap in his gluttonous masculine way. He had taken exactly four
      laps when he ceased to lap. He looked up at his master, and there was a
      disturbed and pained expression in his amber eyes. This expression changed
      in an instant to one of positive fright. He was evidently breathing with
      difficulty, and he was rather at sea, for he groped about on the table and
      put both his forepaws into the bowl, splashing the milk in all directions.
      He then gave a fearful shriek; his pupils dilated horribly in spite of the
      strong sunshine, and he went into convulsions. His breath came quick and
      short. Finally, he fell off the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less than three minutes previously he had been a cat full of power, of
      romance, and of the joy of life, with comfortable views on most things.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;Disappearance of Juliette
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>eople may read
      about crimes in newspapers all their lives, and yet never properly realize
      that crime exists. To appreciate what crime is, one must be brought to
      close quarters with crime, as Carpentaria was. Twelve hours ago murder to
      him had been nothing but a name. Now he knew the horror that murder
      inspires. And with the corpse of the cat Beppo lying at his feet, he felt
      that horror far more keenly even than in the night as he unearthed the
      corpse of the mysterious drunken man. He had actually seen the cat done to
      death, and had it not been for the greediness of Beppo, he himself would
      have lain there, stretched out in eternal quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the half-empty bowl of milk and at the splashes of milk on
      the round painted table, reflecting that each splash was no doubt
      sufficient to kill a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered what he must do, how he must begin to disentangle himself from
      the coil of danger that was surrounding him. He was not afraid. He was
      probably much too excited to be afraid. He was angry, startled, grieved,
      and puzzled, and nothing more. His mind turned naturally to Juliette&mdash;Juliette,
      his comforter and companion. He did not like the idea of frightening her
      by a recital of what had occurred, but he knew that he would be compelled
      to do so. He must talk confidentially to some one who understood him and
      admired him. Now, at that hour in the morning the faithful Juliette, her
      dress ornamented by an extremely small and attractive French apron, was in
      the habit of personally dusting the writing-table in Carpentaria&rsquo;s study
      adjoining the bedroom. No profane hand ever touched that table, and
      Juliette&rsquo;s own hand never ventured to arrange its sublime disorder. There
      were three servants in the house&mdash;the parlourmaid, the cook, and a
      scullery-maid. There might have been a dozen had Juliette so wished. But
      Juliette was a simple person; her father, the second husband of
      Carpentaria&rsquo;s mother, had belonged to the plain and excellent French
      bourgeoisie, who know so well how to cook and how to save money, and
      Juliette had inherited his tastes. Juliette was always curbing
      Carpentaria&rsquo;s instinct towards magnificence. She did not want even three
      servants, and there were a number of delicate tasks, such as the dusting
      of Carpentaria&rsquo;s table, that she would not permit them to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria touched nothing on the balcony. He went into the bedroom,
      fastened the window, and then hesitated. He could hear Juliette&rsquo;s soft
      movements in the study. Ought he, could he, go to her and say bluntly:
      &ldquo;Juliette, some one is trying to murder me, and you must take more care
      than you took this morning&mdash;you allowed my milk to be poisoned&rdquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he opened the door of the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not Juliette dusting the sacred table. It was Jenkins, the
      parlourmaid!
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a thing had never before happened in the united domesticity of
      Carpentaria and Juliette! It was astounding. It unnerved Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      He locked the door of the bedroom, and put the key in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; he demanded gruffly of the parlourmaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dusting your table, sir,&rdquo; replied Jenkins, in a tone that respectfully
      asked to be informed whether Carpentaria was blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you to dust my table?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistress, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your mistress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir. She told me to come up and dust the room.&rdquo; A pause. &ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;really
      don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and find her. Ask her to speak to me at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half a minute, Jenkins. It was you who brought my milk up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you take it from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistress gave it me with her own hands, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you brought it direct to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one else touched it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody called here this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Called, sir?&rdquo; Jenkins seemed ruffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Anybody been to the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Jenkins, as though in asking if anybody had called
      Carpentaria was reflecting upon her moral character. And she blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Go and find your mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenkins departed, and came back in a surprisingly short space of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistress doesn&rsquo;t seem to be about, sir,&rdquo; said Jenkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? She hasn&rsquo;t gone out, has she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I know of, sir. But I can&rsquo;t find her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you looked in her bedroom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knocked at the door, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there was no answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you last see your mistress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When she told me to dust this room, sir, after I had brought up your
      milk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the dining-room, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fearful thought ran through the mind of Carpentaria, cutting it like a
      lancet. Suppose that Juliette had been poisoned! Suppose that an attempt
      had been made against her, as against him, but with more success! He
      hurried out of the room and knocked loudly at her bedroom-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juliette! Are you there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juliette, I say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again no answer. His heart almost stopped. He opened the door and entered
      the room. It was empty, but already the bed had been made and everything
      tidied. He penetrated to the dressing-room, which was equally neat and
      equally empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he searched the house and the premises; he searched everywhere except
      in the little outhouse wherein was hidden the corpse of the drunken man.
      At length, after a futile cross-examination of the cook in the kitchen, he
      perceived that the scullery-maid, in the scullery was surreptitiously
      beckoning to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ungainly chit, Polly, whose person was only kept presentable by the
      ceaseless efforts of Juliette, had red hair, rather less red than
      Carpentaria&rsquo;s, and she worshipped him afar off. She had that &ldquo;cult&rdquo; for
      him which very humble servants do sometimes entertain for masters who
      never even throw them a glance. And now she was beckoning to him and
      making eyes!
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed her through the scullery into the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want mistress, sir?&rdquo; asked Polly in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s over the wye, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, at Mr. Ilam&rsquo;s. Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s been here this morning, sir. Don&rsquo;t
      tell mistress as I told you, sir, for the love of heving!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Juliette was at Ilam&rsquo;s! And he had twice found Juliette in the avenue
      during the night! And she had been strangely excited when she came to kiss
      him before going to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In something less than fifteen seconds he was rattling loudly at Ilam&rsquo;s
      door. He received no answer. He heard no sound within the house. Wondering
      where the servants could be, he assaulted the door again, this time
      furiously. A man who was rolling a lawn in the Oriental Gardens glanced up
      at him. Still there was no reply. He was just deciding to break into the
      house by way of a window, when the door opened very suddenly, and as he
      was leaning upon it, he pitched forward into the hall and into the arms of
      old Mrs. Ilam, who, with her white cap, her black dress and her parchment
      face, seemed aggrieved by this entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Carpentaria!&rdquo; she protested, raising her shaking hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was admirably and overpoweringly calm, and her extreme age
      prevented Carpentaria from taking the measures which he would have taken
      had she been younger, less imposing, less august, less like a dead woman
      who walked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister is here, and I must see her at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Carpentaria; your sister is not here.&rdquo; Her tone startled him. It
      was so cold and positive. But after a few seconds he thought she was
      lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has been here, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Carpentaria. She has not been here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really! But you have seen her this morning. You came to my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Mrs. Ilam, I saw you from my&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&mdash;from your balcony? You saw me cross the avenue, but you did not
      see me enter your house. You could not have seen that from your balcony,
      even if I had entered; and, as it happens, I didn&rsquo;t enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My servants say you came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your servants probably say a good many things, Mr. Carpentaria,&rdquo; she
      smiled humorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The musician felt himself against a stone wall. &ldquo;Can I see your son?&rdquo; he
      asked at length of the imperturbable old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son is in bed and far from well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I should like to talk to you instead,&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to burst into welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, then, my dear man, do! Come in!&rdquo; And she preceded him into the
      drawing-room, an apartment furnished in the richest Tottenham Court Road
      splendour. They sat down on either side of the hearth, where a fire was
      burning. He did not know exactly how to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Carpentaria,&rdquo; she encouraged him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some very strange things have been happening, Mrs. Ilam,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      He deemed that he might as well go directly to the point. He would come to
      Juliette afterwards. So long as Juliette was not in Ilam&rsquo;s house she was
      probably in no immediate danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To you?&rdquo; asked the dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me. I saw some very strange things with my own eyes last night, and
      within the last twelve Lours there have been two attempts to murder me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slight flush reddened the wrinkled yellow cheek of Mrs. Ilam. It seemed
      as though she tried to speak and could not. Her fingers worked
      convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, too?&rdquo; he murmured, with apparent difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say &lsquo;you, too&rsquo;?&rdquo; Carpentaria demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the milk?&rdquo; she seemed to stammer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the second attempt; it was the milk,&rdquo; admitted Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hid her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same attempt has been made against Josephus,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And he was
      so frightened it has made him ill. That is why he is not feeling very well
      this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But does Mr. Ilam take milk for breakfast? I thought he always had ham
      and eggs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said Mrs. Ilam. &ldquo;Hot bread-and-milk. Nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did he find out that the milk was poisoned?&rdquo; Carpentaria pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ilam. &ldquo;But he did. He&rsquo;s very particular
      about his food, is Jos. And he suspected something. So he tried it on
      Neptune, the Newfoundland. And Neptune is dead. He says he thinks it must
      be prussic acid. Oh, Mr. Carpentaria, what is this plot against us all?
      What are we to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria was reduced to muteness. The old lady had changed the trend of
      his thoughts. He had been secretly accusing Ilam, but if Ilam&rsquo;s life also
      had been attempted, the case was very much altered. It was perhaps even
      more perilous. Still, Mrs. Ilam had done nothing to explain the
      extraordinary events of the night. He decided to be cautious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I happened to see lights in your house very late last night, or rather,
      early this morning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was afraid that either you or Mr. Ilam
      might be ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes sought hers and met them fully and squarely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed sadly. &ldquo;Jos had a dreadful night. He does have them
      sometimes, you know. Bad dreams. In many ways he is just like a child.
      There are nights when I think his dreams are more real to him than his
      real life. Now, last night he dreamed there was a corpse lying on a bier
      in the avenue, and nothing would satisfy him but that I should come out
      with him to see. Fancy it! at my age! However, there was nothing&mdash;of
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria said to himself that the old lady evidently was unaware of her
      son&rsquo;s midnight escapade, and that he could get no further with her. The
      hope sprang up within him that Polly had been after all mistaken. Juliette
      might have gone out merely for a stroll and have returned ere then. He
      rose to take leave of Mrs. Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; she asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear man, about this attempted poisoning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we must inform the police,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;But perhaps it would be well to wait
      until you had had a talk with Jos. He&rsquo;ll be getting up during the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing it&rsquo;s Sunday and we&rsquo;re free, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had got precisely as far as the drawing-room door, when a voice reached
      his ears from the upper story. &ldquo;Mrs. Ilam! Mrs. Ilam! He&rsquo;s eaten his ham
      and eggs. What about the marmalade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria dashed into the hall and looked up the stairs, and he saw the
      head of Juliette over the banisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind him he heard a suppressed sigh from Mrs. Ilam.

      CHAPTER IX&mdash;The Dead Dog
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>arpentaria ran up
      the stairs. If he had not had flame-coloured hair, and the fiery temper
      that goes with it, he would probably have pursued the more dignified
      course of calling Juliette down and interrogating her in privacy. But he
      was Carpentaria. She knew his moods, and she fled before him into a
      sitting-room, where Ilam, a dressing-gown covering his suit of Sunday
      black, reclined in an easy-chair by the side of a small table bearing an
      empty plate and a knife and fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      She cowered down on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Carlos!&rdquo; she exclaimed under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria made the obvious demand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing in this house, Juliette?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Carpentaria,&rdquo; Ilam began, rising a little in a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; cried Carpentaria angrily and threateningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at the noise the great dog Neptune, pride of the Ilams, emerged from
      behind the chair and growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juliette said at last:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Ilam told me that Jos&mdash;that Mr. Ilam was unwell, and so I&mdash;I
      came to see how he was. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;Is that all? Your philanthropic interest in
      the sick and suffering, my girl, does you great credit. But as the invalid
      seems to be doing fairly well you&rsquo;d better come home with me. I want to
      talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Juliette gave a look of appeal to Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must tell him,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I must tell Carlos. Why did you want me
      to keep it a secret? Carlos, Mr. Ilam and I are engaged to be married. We
      love each other. We only want your consent, and Jos was afraid you
      mightn&rsquo;t give it. He was afraid. We&rsquo;ve been engaged three days now,
      haven&rsquo;t we, Jos?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My consent!&rdquo; Carpentaria shouted bitterly. &ldquo;My consent!&rdquo; His wrath was
      dreadful, and yet to a certain extent he was controlling himself. &ldquo;I
      suppose,&rdquo; he addressed Juliette, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s your love for this estimable
      gentleman that leads you out into the gardens of a night, and I suppose
      you take beautiful romantic moonlight strolls together. My consent! Ye
      gods!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog continued to growl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juliette gathered herself together, and moved to Ilam&rsquo;s chair, and Ilam
      took her hand protectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor dear! Never mind!&rdquo; murmured Ilam soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genuine affection spoke in those tones uttered by the stout and otherwise
      grotesque Mr. Ilam. Love itself unmistakably appeared in the attitude of
      the pair as they clasped hands in front of Carpentaria&rsquo;s fury. And
      Carpentaria could not but be struck by what he saw. It sobered him,
      puzzled him, diverted his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Juliette,&rdquo; he said in a quieter, more persuasive tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to leave the room, and Juliette obediently followed. Allowing
      her to pass before him, he stopped an instant and threw a glance at Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they&rsquo;ve been trying to poison you, Ilam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poison me!&rdquo; repeated Ilam, plainly at a loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Carpentaria with a sneer. &ldquo;And you never have ham and eggs for
      breakfast. That&rsquo;s the reason why that plate is streaked with yellow. You
      always have milk. Naturally, you eat it with a knife and fork. And you
      suspected the milk and gave some of it to Neptune, and he fell down dead.
      He looks dead, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; Ilam said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must ask mamma,&rdquo; replied Carpentaria, departing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw now with the utmost clearness that the aged Mrs. Ilam had been
      indulging him with some impromptu lying, invented, and clumsily invented,
      to put him off the scent, were it only for a few hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may be clumsy in her lying,&rdquo; he thought as he descended the stairs in
      Juliette&rsquo;s wake, &ldquo;but she can act, the old woman can!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He remembered that her acting had been perfect, and if Juliette had not
      happened to disclose the fact of her presence, the lying of Mrs. Ilam,
      clumsy as it was, might have succeeded. It is so easy to poison a dog, and
      to arrange the remains of poisoned milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was capable of congratulating her on her acting, but she had utterly
      vanished from the ground-floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had deposited Juliette safely in his study, she began to cry
      softly. It was impossible for him to maintain his anger against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juliette,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why do you have secrets from me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Carlos, he wished it to be kept secret. He said he had reasons; and I
      love him. No one has ever loved me before, and I&rsquo;m thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about my affection?&rdquo; asked Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s different!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he questioned her about Mrs. Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was at the kitchen window, preparing your milk, and the window was
      open, and Mrs. Ilam came up outside, and told me that Jos was unwell, and
      wanted to see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she touch the milk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Touch the milk? No; why should she touch the milk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could she reach to touch the milk, supposing she had wished to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say she could. Yes, she could. But why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you swear absolutely she didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t swear; but I&rsquo;m nearly sure. Carlos, what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you what I mean!&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      He unlocked the bedroom door and led her to the balcony.

      CHAPTER X&mdash;A Pinch of Snuff
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hree hours later
      Carpentaria, whose thoughts had been bent upon some solution of the
      problem set by Juliette&rsquo;s strange and incomprehensible love affair with
      Josephus Ilam, was obliged to devote his brains to other and not less
      disturbing matters. He received in his study, for the second time that
      day, young Rivers, the newly-admitted doctor who had been officially
      attached to the City of Pleasure. A medical cabinet and a pharmacy had
      been judged quite indispensable to the smooth running of the City, and the
      foresight which had provided them was entirely justified by the numerous
      small accidents, faintings, and indispositions that marked the opening
      day, when more than three hundred persons had patronized the pharmacy, and
      more than twenty had received the attentions of the ardent young doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria had first met young Rivers when this youth was walking Bart&rsquo;s,
      and the accession of Rivers to the brilliant and brilliantly remunerated
      position of physician and surgeon-in-ordinary to the City of Pleasure was
      due to Carpentaria&rsquo;s influence. Rivers was grateful, very grateful.
      Moreover, he liked Carpentaria, thought him, in fact, the most wonderful
      man, except Lord Lister, that he had ever met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the fair youth of twenty-five, when Carpentaria had shut the
      study-door, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made the analysis. It comes out to just about what I
      expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prussic acid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly prussic acid. A soluble cyanide&mdash;cyanide of potassium.
      Have you by any chance got a photographic bureau concealed somewhere in
      the show?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know? It&rsquo;s next door to
      the lecture-hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the cyanide of potassium was probably got from there. It&rsquo;s used by
      photographers. Better make inquiries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will,&rdquo; Carpentaria agreed. &ldquo;And do you mean to say cyanide of
      potassium will kill like that? How much prussic acid does it contain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarcely any. Not two per cent.&mdash;not one per cent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And poor Beppo was dead in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Carpentaria,&rdquo; said Rivers excitedly. &ldquo;The strongest solution
      of prussic acid known to commerce only contains four per cent, of pure
      acid. And in the anhydrous state&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anhydrous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means without water. In the anhydrous state,&rdquo; Rivers proceeded
      enthusiastically, &ldquo;two grains will kill a man in a second of time. Like
      that! It&rsquo;s an amazing poison!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he said, as if casually, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a corpse I want you to
      look at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A corpse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep calm, my young friend,&rdquo; Carpentaria enjoined him. And he told him
      the history of the drunken man. &ldquo;Naturally all this is strictly
      confidential,&rdquo; he concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so,&rdquo; said Rivers, aghast. &ldquo;Can you not see that you have
      got yourself into a dreadful mess? You are an accessory after the fact.
      You have been guilty of a gross illegality. I don&rsquo;t know what the penalty
      is; I&rsquo;m not very well up in medical jurisprudence; but I know it&rsquo;s
      something pretty stiff. Why, you might be accused of the murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am aware of all that,&rdquo; answered Carpentaria. &ldquo;But I was very
      curious; and I didn&rsquo;t want any police meddling here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going just the way to bring them here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. When you have made your examination I shall simply put the
      body where I found it. No one will be the wiser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And theft?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;we shall see. It will depend on your examination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, really, Mr. Carpentaria, I cannot lend myself&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to oblige me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria smiled an engaging smile, and they descended together to the
      outhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outhouse was not more than eleven feet square, and the barrow with its
      burden was stretched across it diagonally, so that when the two men were
      inside, the place was full and the door would scarcely close. A small
      window gave light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rivers gently pulled the black cloth aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is just such black cloth as photographers use,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the corpse were closed; he might have been a man asleep, this
      strange relic from which a soul had flown and which would soon resolve
      itself into its original dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow,&rdquo; thought Carpentaria. &ldquo;Once he lived, and had interests, and
      probably passions, and thought himself of some importance in the
      universe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The spectacle saddened Carpentaria, whereas the young doctor was not at
      all saddened, he was merely intensely interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A blow on the head among other things,&rdquo; he observed, indicating to
      Carpentaria the top of the skull which showed an abrasion together with an
      extravasation of blood, now clotted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would that do it?&rdquo; queried Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Might. By Jove, the rigor is extraordinarily acute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rigor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      7.8
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stiffness that follows death. Great Scott!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor assumed an upright position, and stared, first at the corpse
      and then at Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor made no reply, but tried to lift the left arm of the body. He
      could not, without raising the entire body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is most interesting,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Rivers did not answer. Instead, he took his watch from his pocket,
      and put it suddenly against the ear of the corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The corpse twitched; its head moved slightly; the eyelid lifted the eighth
      of an inch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See that? You&rsquo;re lucky! And so&rsquo;s he!&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s catalepsy!
      that&rsquo;s all&mdash;A sudden slight noise at the ear itself will often
      produce a change of position in catalepsy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s not dead!&rdquo; exclaimed Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead? He&rsquo;s no more dead than you are! It&rsquo;s just catalepsy, induced
      probably by that blow. But he must have been very excited previously, and,
      no doubt, suffering from melancholia too. My dear Mr. Carpentaria, there
      is only one absolutely reliable symptom of death, and that is&mdash;putrefaction.
      Death is imitated by various diseases. But there are not many that will
      imitate the coldness of death as catalepsy will. Feel that hand; it&rsquo;s like
      ice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how long will he remain in this condition?&rdquo; asked Carpentaria, full
      of joy and relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till you go and bring me some snuff. Snuff is the best thing in these
      cases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he&rsquo;ll be perfectly well again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in a day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll remember&mdash;things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he will! Shall I go for that snuff, or will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will run,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, and he ran.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI&mdash;The Return to Life
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was half-past
      seven o&rsquo;clock on Monday evening. More than thirty hours had elapsed since
      young Rivers first began his operations to restore life to the cataleptic
      patient, and he was only just succeeding in an affair which had proved
      extremely difficult and protracted. Young Rivers, in fact, had found out
      during the watches of Sunday night and the sunny morning of Monday that
      the disease (if catalepsy may be called a disease) has a habit of flatly
      defying the rules of medical text-books and the experience of even the
      youngest doctors. But ultimately he had triumphed, though not by means of
      the famous snuff, which Carpentaria had obtained, after exhaustive
      research, from a bass-fiddle player in his band.
    </p>
    <p>
      The patient reclined, alive, conscious, capable of movement and speech,
      but otherwise a prodigious enigma, in an arm-chair in Carpentaria&rsquo;s
      bedroom. His existence was a profound secret from all except the doctor
      and the musician.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now these two, who had brought him back to earthly life, wanted him to
      talk, to explain himself, to unravel the mysteries of Saturday afternoon
      and Saturday night. And Carpentaria, dressed in his uniform, waited, watch
      in hand; for in half an hour the daily concert must commence in the
      Oriental Gardens. Nothing could interfere with Carpentaria&rsquo;s presence in
      the gorgeous illuminated bandstand. He had sacrificed his interest in his
      half-sister, his curiosity about the doings of the Ilams, his inspection
      of the affairs of the City, and even a rehearsal, to the care of the
      recovering cataleptic, but the concert itself, with its audience of a
      hundred thousand or so, could not be sacrificed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are Carpentaria?&rdquo; murmured the patient, sipping at a glass of hot
      milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      His age now appeared to be fifty. He had grey hair and a short grey beard,
      rather whiter than the hair, and his eyes bore the expression of a man who
      has found that life bears no striking resemblance to a good joke. His
      hands moved nervously over the surfaces of the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Carpentaria admitted; &ldquo;and you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first direct question that he had ventured to put to the
      enigma, and the enigma ignored it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say I was buried and you unburied me?&rdquo; he pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Carpentaria enthusiastically, and he described the journeys,
      the disappearances and the reappearances, of the body of the enigma on the
      opening night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I should have died really, if I&rsquo;d been left alone?&rdquo; the enigma
      demanded of Rivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; said Rivers. &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enigma turned almost fiercely on Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why, in the name of common sense, couldn&rsquo;t you have left me alone?&rdquo;
       he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as though he owed Carpentaria a grudge which the most cruel
      ingenuity could not satisfy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Carpentaria stammered, too surprised to
      be able to argue well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought you were doing a mighty clever thing,&rdquo; snapped the enigma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I merely&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or, rather,&rdquo; the enigma proceeded, &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t think at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rivers and Carpentaria exchanged a glance, indicating to each other that
      the man was an invalid and must therefore be humoured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo; Carpentaria began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me Jetsam,&rdquo; the invalid interrupted. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t my name, but it&rsquo;s
      near enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Jetsam&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Mr. Jetsam, sitting up in the chair. &ldquo;There I was,
      comfortably dead, blind and deaf for evermore to the stupidities, the
      shams, the crimes, and the tedium of this world, and you go and
      deliberately recreate me! Is your opinion of the earth, and particularly
      of England, so high that you imagine a man is better on it than off it?
      Have you reached your present position and your present age, without
      coming to the conclusion that a person once comfortably dead would never
      want to be alive again? It seems to me, that you took upon yourselves the
      responsibility, the terrible responsibility of putting me back into life
      without giving the matter a moment&rsquo;s serious thought. And I do verily
      believe that you expected me to be grateful! Grateful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a question of duty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Carpentaria ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course. It only remained for you to drag in that word; I
      anticipated it. And why was it your duty? Who told you it was your duty?
      What authority have you for saying it was your duty? None&mdash;absolutely
      none! The sole explanation of your conduct is that, like most human
      beings, you are an interfering busybody; you can&rsquo;t leave a thing alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At length Carpentaria laughed. He was conscious of a certain liking for
      Mr. Jetsam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can but offer you my humble apologies,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They are of no avail;
      they will not undo what is done. But none the less I offer them to you.
      You see, when I last saw you alive, you were so drunk, so very drunk&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not drunk at all,&rdquo; said Mr. Jetsam. &ldquo;And your inability to perceive
      the fact proves that, though you may be able to wear a very stylish
      uniform and to make a great deal of noise with a band, you are an infant
      as a detective. No, sir, I had certain plans to execute, and you, with
      that meddlesomeness that appears to characterize you, came along and
      interfered. In order that I might be left alone I pretended to be drunk. I
      have never been drunk in my life, which is conceivably more than you can
      say for yourself, or you, sir&rdquo;&mdash;and he pointed to the young doctor,
      who had only recently finished being a medical student.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And those plans&mdash;may one inquire?&rdquo; Carpentaria murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jetsam covered his face with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he sighed, evidently speaking to himself. &ldquo;I had done with all that,
      and now I must begin again. My instincts will inevitably drive me to begin
      again. My dear people&rdquo;&mdash;he surveyed his two companions with an acid
      and distant stare&mdash;&ldquo;instead of saving life, you have only set in
      motion a chain of circumstances that will lead to the loss of it. Murder
      and the scaffold will probably be the net result of your officious zeal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a rap on the bedroom door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five minutes to eight, sir,&rdquo; called a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, getting up; and to Mr. Jetsam, &ldquo;I will see you
      after the concert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; said Mr. Jetsam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I shall be gone. I am feeling quite strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      35
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to talk to you about certain people,&rdquo; pursued Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Josephus Ilam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all about Josephus Ilam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his mother. Perhaps you don&rsquo;t know all about his mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jetsam jumped to his feet with singular agility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Ilam! She&rsquo;s been dead for years,&rdquo; he said gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was very much alive this morning,&rdquo; replied Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me she was dead,&rdquo; Jetsam muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lied. She is in the bungalow opposite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Jetsam breathed, and he seemed to breathe the breath out of his
      body. He swayed and fell back into the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! He&rsquo;s fainted!&rdquo; exclaimed Rivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look after him,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, and flew downstairs and towards his
      bandstand.

      CHAPTER XII&mdash;On the Wheel
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he concert was
      over. If it had been as great a triumph as usual&mdash;and it had&mdash;the
      reasons were perhaps that nothing succeeds like success, and that the
      Carpentaria band was so imbued with the spirit of Carpentaria that it
      would have played in the Carpentaria manner even had the shade of
      Beethoven come down to conduct it. Certainly Carpentaria&rsquo;s performances
      with the baton, though wild and bizarre, lacked that sincerity and that
      amazing invention which usually distinguished them. He had too much to
      think about. There was the possibility of getting shot as he stood there.
      There was the possibility of being poisoned at his next meal. There was
      the possibility of some fearful complication with Juliette and Ilam. There
      was the positive mystery of Ilam himself. There was the comparative
      mystery of Ilam&rsquo;s mother. And there was the superlative mystery of Mr.
      Jetsam. Under these circumstances, with all these pre-occupations, the
      plaudits of a hundred thousand people did not particularly interest
      Carpentaria that night. His chief desire was to get back to Mr. Jetsam,
      and to extract Mr. Jetsam&rsquo;s secrets out of Mr. Jetsam either by force, by
      fraud, or by persuasion. As he was bowing languidly for the nineteenth
      time, and the entire orchestra was bowing behind him, amid a hurricane of
      clapping, he thought to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing I&rsquo;m not in love! It would only need that, in addition
      to what I already have on my hands, to drive me crazy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a fact, he had never been in love. Art, particularly as expressed by
      brass instruments, was his mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to descend the steps from the bandstand, when he perceived a
      tall African standing at attention at the bottom of the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he asked the African.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man smiled the placid and infantile smile of his race, and handed a
      note to Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You from the Soudanese village?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The inhabitant of the Soudanese village, which was one of the attractions
      of the hippodrome, stood about six feet four inches high, and he was in
      native costume, which consisted largely, but not exclusively, of beads and
      polish. To gaze, dazzled, at the polish on that man&rsquo;s face, shoulders,
      chest, and calves, one would guess that the whole tribe must sit up at
      nights bringing his polish to such a unique pitch of perfection. In his
      cheek you could see yourself as in a mirror, and he had the air of being
      personally well satisfied with the splendour of his mahogany skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria opened the note. It read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please come to me at once.&mdash;Ilam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Should he go? Or should he refuse this strange invitation, and hasten at
      once to Mr. Jetsam and the doctor?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Mr. Ilam?&rdquo; he demanded of the Soudanese.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Soudanese merely increased his smile, and pointed vaguely in the
      direction of the Amusement Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where, man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sah!&rdquo; He lifted an arm and pointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upper part of the illuminated rim of the giant wheel, a hundred feet
      higher than any other wheel in the world, could be seen over the roofs of
      the lofty white buildings in the Central Way. At this moment a rushing,
      roaring noise was heard to the east, and simultaneously the lights of the
      giant wheel were extinguished. Carpentaria glanced round. A rocket burst
      with a faint reverberation in the sky, a little colony of crimson stars
      floated for a few seconds amid the clouds&mdash;some stars had the shape
      of the letter I and others of the letter C&mdash;and then they expired,
      and the sky was black again. Cheers greeted the ingenious signal for the
      commencement of the first pyrotechnic display of the City of Pleasure, and
      a small crowd, which was beginning to form in the neighbourhood of the
      Soudanese, frittered itself suddenly away in a rush towards the
      Embankment. The fireworks were discharged from a plot of ground on the
      other side of the river&mdash;a plot specially leased for that sole
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with you,&rdquo; said Carpentaria to the Soudanese. He had decided
      that an interview with Ilam could not do any harm, and there was always
      the chance that it might in some way prove decisive. As for Mr. Jetsam, he
      would deal with Mr. Jetsam later. Possibly Ilam might have determined to
      make a general confession to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he had his revolver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Soudanese walked quickly, and he was several inches taller than
      Carpentaria. In something less than five minutes they had arrived at the
      entrance to the Amusements Park, which was closing for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Mr. Ilam?&rdquo; Carpentaria asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Soudanese smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood at the foot of the giant wheel, all of whose sixty cars were in
      darkness save one, and this car was at the bottom, and its door was open.
      Near the door stood a single official in the uniform of the City.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria began to be puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ilam at the top?&rdquo; he asked the official.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so, sir,&rdquo; said the official, after hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria went into the car. The Soudanese shut the sliding door,
      remaining himself outside. The official blew a whistle, and the giant
      wheel began slowly to revolve with a terrific vibration and straining of
      chains and rods. The car was designed to hold sixty people&mdash;when the
      giant wheel was in full work it earned a hundred and eighty pounds per
      revolution&mdash;and Carpentaria felt lonely in it. &ldquo;Is this some trap?&rdquo;
       his thoughts ran; and he said to himself that he didn&rsquo;t care whether it
      was a trap or not. As the car rose in the sky he had a superb view of the
      fireworks, which were now in full career&mdash;an immense and glittering
      tapestry of changing coloured flame, reflected hue for hue and tint for
      tint on the calm surface of the Thames beneath. And high above the
      pyrotechnics lightning was beginning to play. The day had been hot, even
      close, and it had been a pleasing surprise to the money-takers of the City
      that rain had not fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the wheel shuddered, shook, and stopped. The car was at the
      summit, three hundred and forty feet above the level of the earth. A
      figure appeared on the flying platform outside the car. The door was
      opened, and Ilam entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this?&rdquo; Carpentaria demanded of him, standing up
      suddenly, and instinctively feeling the handle of his revolver with his
      right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means that I wish to talk to you in private,&rdquo; answered Ham,
      emphasizing the last two words; &ldquo;and there seems to me to be no place
      particularly private down below now,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you infer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I don&rsquo;t quite know what I infer,&rdquo; said Ilam. &ldquo;All I can tell you
      is that this City has been getting rather peculiar this last day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has,&rdquo; Carpentaria agreed pointedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as you went to the trouble of taking me up in that thing&rdquo;&mdash;he
      indicated overhead, where the captive balloon was darting a searchlight to
      and fro across the expanse of the grounds&mdash;&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d go to the
      trouble of bringing you up here. It&rsquo;s safer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria noticed how pale the man was, how changed his visage, and how
      nervous his demeanour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it is,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit down,&rdquo; replied Ilam, clearing his throat, and they sat down on
      opposite sides of the car. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain what I want in three words. How
      much will you take to clear out? I&rsquo;m a plain man&mdash;how much will you
      take to clear out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clear out of the City? I won&rsquo;t take anything,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;All the
      gold of all the Rockefellers won&rsquo;t clear me out. I&rsquo;ve got the largest
      audience for my band that any bandmaster ever had, and I like it. It&rsquo;s
      worth more than money to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it worth more than life to you?&rdquo; asked the heavy President, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I reckon I can keep my life and my audience, too,&rdquo; said
      Carpentaria. &ldquo;At any rate, you&rsquo;ve tried to have my life twice and failed,
      and that hasn&rsquo;t frightened me. I&rsquo;m less frightened than you are, even.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not tried to kill you,&rdquo; said Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve tried to shoot me and to poison me. Why, I cannot imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not,&rdquo; repeated Ilam.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, in spite of himself, Carpentaria was impressed by the apparent
      truthfulness of Ilam&rsquo;s tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then who has?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea,&rdquo; said Ilam lamely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, what you
      are referring to. But I&rsquo;ll give you fifty thousand a year for ten years to
      go&mdash;to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here. I stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, you&rsquo;ll take the consequences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always take the consequences. But what consequences, my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Ilam coughed, &ldquo;you say there have been attempts on your life.
      Suppose they are continued? What then? I should like to save you. And
      perhaps I can only save you by persuading you to vanish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awfully good of you,&rdquo; Carpentaria sneered. &ldquo;But I assure you that these
      attempts on my life interest me enormously. I wouldn&rsquo;t miss them for a
      fortune. I&rsquo;m beginning rather to like them. One gets used to an atmosphere
      of mystery. No, Mr. President, I shall not go; but Juliette will go. I
      shall send Juliette away to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ilam bit his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That remains to be seen,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;She likes me. I should make her a
      good husband. Why do you object to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you court her in the dark? Why do you force her to have secrets
      from me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s neither here nor there,&rdquo; said Ilam. &ldquo;I should make her a good
      husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what sort of a mother-in-law would she have if she married you?&rdquo;
       demanded Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilam made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Carpentaria, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good thing for a woman
      to have a husband who is always seeing ghosts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing ghosts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see ghosts?&rdquo; sneered Carpentaria. &ldquo;N&mdash;no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down with me, and I&rsquo;ll show you one, then,&rdquo; said the bandmaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had conceived the idea of confronting Ilam with Mr. Jetsam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shifting searchlight from the balloon fell dazzlingly across the car,
      and through the window Carpentaria saw plainly for the fraction of a
      second the polished face of the Soudanese. Then it disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rushed to the door, flung it open, and gazed downwards into the weblike
      tracery of the steel-work which shone dully in the white glare of the
      searchlight. A zigzag stairway, incomparably slender, stretched away
      towards earth along the face of the colossal wheel, and a dark figure
      slipped rapidly from rung to rung of the dizzy ladder. Then the light
      moved capriciously away, and all was indistinguishable blackness.

      CHAPTER XIII&mdash;Performances of Mr. Jetsam
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>arpentaria slipped
      back into the car with a shiver, as it occurred to him that Ilam, had he
      so chosen, might have pushed him into three hundred and forty
      perpendicular feet of space. But Ilam had not moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll descend. Ring the bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ilam. &ldquo;I want to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll descend,&rdquo; Carpentaria insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about Juliette,&rdquo; pleaded Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll descend,&rdquo; said Carpentaria a third time. &ldquo;Ring the bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down, took his revolver from his pocket, and put it ostentatiously
      on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilam sighed, and pushed the white disc that communicated with the
      engine-house, and a few moments later a vibration went through the wheel,
      and it resumed its revolution. The car came down on the side nearest the
      river, and its occupants had a superb view of the final items of the
      display of fireworks. Among them were two portraits, in living flame, of
      the twin gods of the City of Pleasure, and under each headpiece was the
      name of its subject: &ldquo;Ilam,&rdquo; &ldquo;Carpentaria.&rdquo; The cheers of the immense
      multitude greeted their ears. Then there was another sound, but it came
      from above instead of from below. Ilam shrank as if afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be frightened,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the trumpet of
      the Day of Judgment, it&rsquo;s only the beginning of a thunderstorm. It&rsquo;s just
      come in nice time to soak everybody through on their way home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rain spattered viciously on the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the ground a strange sight met their eyes&mdash;the
      sight of seas and oceans of black, shining umbrellas, surging in waves
      from all directions towards the Central Way and the exits from the City,
      and as the umbrellas reached the covered footpaths of the Central Way they
      collapsed and showed human beings. And then, at all the exits from the
      City, all these umbrellas&mdash;and it was estimated that there were over
      a quarter of a million of them&mdash;sprang again into life, and hid their
      owners. The tempest was already at its height.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, as Ilam sought to leave him, when they
      quitted the Amusements Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ilam flatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood side by side in the open, heedless of the rain, while shelter
      in the shape of the sidewalks of the Central Way was within a few yards of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The searchlight from the balloon still swept about the grounds, but the
      fireworks were finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall come with me and see a ghost,&rdquo; insisted Carpentaria angrily and
      obstinately, &ldquo;or I will make such a scandal in this place as will go far
      to ruin it. Let me tell you that I know a great deal more than you think.
      I am in a position, for example, to ask you, Ilam, whether you spend your
      nights in bed or wandering about the grounds carrying mysterious burdens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A group of visitors hurried past them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; muttered Ilam. &ldquo;I&mdash;you must be going off your
      head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless I&rsquo;m a madman, eh? Well, come along with the madman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ilam sighed. They passed into the Central Way, and had to fight for
      progress against the multitudes that crowded the footpaths. No one
      recognized them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we could understand each other,&rdquo; said Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall, rest assured of that,&rdquo; returned Carpentaria. &ldquo;In quite a few
      minutes we shall understand each other, or I am mistaken, and it may be
      you that will have to leave this City&mdash;and with considerably less
      than fifty thousand a year, my friend.&rdquo; He pictured the moment when he
      should confront Ilam with the man whose corpse Ilam had buried. Vistas
      opened out before him. He saw the tables completely turned; he saw himself
      sole master of the City, and the wielder of such power over Ilam as would
      enforce obedience to his wishes. Then there would be no more insulting
      requests to abandon his music, no more ridiculous suggestions, and no fear
      of foolishness on the part of Juliette. It astonished him that he had not
      realized before the enormous latent power which his knowledge of Saturday
      night gave him over Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come with me to my house,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; asked Ilam wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Rivers&mdash;and the ghost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is all this nonsense about a ghost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall see him first, and then, when you have seen him&mdash;before he
      has seen you&mdash;you shall tell me whether or not you would like to have
      a chat with him. It is a ghost warranted to talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ilam said nothing. He was naturally at a complete loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the bungalow by means of Carpentaria&rsquo;s latchkey, and they
      mounted to the first-floor, and they went into the study. The door of the
      bedroom was shut. Carpentaria led Ilam out on to the balcony of the study
      window, from which it was not difficult, even for Ilam, to climb into the
      balcony of the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you shall look into my bedroom,&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he himself looked first. It may be said that he was astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was lighted. There were no signs of Mr. Jetsam, but two chairs
      had been overturned, and young Rivers lay prone on the floor, his eyes
      shut, and some blood flowing from a wound in his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria sprang into the room, and, strange to say, Ilam followed him.
      The fact was that Ilam did really for the moment believe Carpentaria to be
      mad, and the bedroom to be the scene of some maniacal crime. .
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Rivers came to his senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you, Mr. Carpentaria?&rdquo; he murmured, rubbing his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. What&rsquo;s happened? Where&rsquo;s Jetsam, as he calls himself? You&rsquo;re not
      seriously hurt, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the name of Jetsam, Ilam caught his breath and took hold of a bedpost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jetsam?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You evidently recognize the name of my ghost,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, &ldquo;though
      he isn&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He bashed me on the head with a chair,&rdquo; said the doctor, sitting up and
      putting a handkerchief to his head, &ldquo;and I suppose I must have&mdash;&mdash;
      It can&rsquo;t be more than a minute or two since&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what was he doing? Where&rsquo;s he gone?&rdquo; inquired Carpentaria
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He recovered consciousness quite quickly,&rdquo; answered Rivers, &ldquo;and I gave
      him something to drink; then he asked me about Mrs. Ilam, and I told him
      she lived with Mr. Ilam here, and he grew very excited, and said he must
      go to her at once. I said he couldn&rsquo;t; I said you wouldn&rsquo;t allow that, and
      he pretended to agree; but it was only a pretence. He began to talk about
      other things, and then, all of a sudden, he sprang at me, and that&rsquo;s as
      much as I remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a word Carpentaria ran out downstairs and into the avenue. The
      door of Ilam&rsquo;s house stood wide open. He entered. In the hall he perceived
      that the door of the drawing-room was also wide open, and he entered the
      drawing-room..There was no light in the room save that of a match, and the
      match was held by Mr. Jetsam. Mr. Jetsam stood staring at Mrs. Ilam, and
      Mrs. Ilam sat motionless in her chair, apparently trying to articulate and
      not succeeding. An appalling fear shone in her eyes. No sound could be
      heard except the rattling of the rain on the French window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jetsam turned, and in the same second he dropped the match. The room
      was in darkness. Then followed a crash of glass and splintering of wood,
      and then a heavy fall in the apartment itself. With some trouble,
      Carpentaria found the electric switch and turned on the light. Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s
      lips were still trembling in a vain effort to speak. Her son lay stretched
      and whimpering at her feet. Mr. Jetsam had vanished. The window was in
      ruins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Rivers appeared. He had bandaged his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is paralysed!&rdquo; said the doctor, when he had examined Mrs. Ilam. &ldquo;She
      will never again have the use of her limbs or her organs of speech. She
      will be able to see and to hear, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIV&mdash;Entry of the Twins
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is a singular
      fact that the secondary stage of the drama which I am relating was
      tremendously, vitally, influenced by the marriage of Mr. Luke Shooter,
      junior partner in Shooter&rsquo;s, a firm of wholesale ribbon merchants in
      Cannon Street. Luke Shooter did not know it. Luke Shooter had nothing
      whatever to do with the drama; it is very, probable that he never even
      heard of it, except such trifling fragments as got into the newspapers.
      Nevertheless, by the mere fact of marrying, Luke Shooter unconsciously
      changed the course of events in the City of Pleasure. For he was a man of
      broad views, and he liked people to think well of him, and so it occurred
      that, at his suggestion, the multitudinous staff of Shooter&rsquo;s was given a
      complete holiday on the day of his marriage, and that day happened to be
      Tuesday, May 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for Mr. Luke Shooter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the employés spent the latter half of the day in the City of
      Pleasure, which was now the rage, the craze, and the vogue of London, and
      among these were the twin sisters, Pauline and Rosie Dartmouth. Pauline
      and Rosie were typists in the house of Shooters. Their age was twenty-six.
      They were tall, and rather slim; only Rosie, the younger, was not quite so
      slim as Pauline. Pauline was dark; Rosie was inclined to fairness. In the
      partnership between them Pauline supplied the common sense, while Rosie
      supplied the gaiety; each supplied a considerable amount of beauty and
      charm, and a sum of thirty-five shillings a week. It is obvious that on a
      total income of three pounds ten a week, or a hundred and eighty-two
      pounds a year, two girls living together in a small flat, with sense and
      gaiety and full opportunity for acquiring ribbons at wholesale prices, may
      have a very good time and cut quite a pretty figure in the world. And this
      Pauline and Rosie certainly did manage to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were orphans, and had been for a very long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came to the City by the Tube from their flat in Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush, and
      Pauline put a florin down for the two of them at the northern entrance
      gates, just as though they had been ordinary visitors; as, in fact, at
      that moment they were. A few persons noticed them, but quite casually, and
      only because they were dressed&mdash;and well dressed&mdash;almost exactly
      alike. There are so many beautiful young women in London that Londoners
      seldom turn their heads to look at one. It is left to Frenchmen to rave
      about the blond charm of the Anglo-Saxon &ldquo;mees.&rdquo; What exuberant adjectives
      the Frenchman would find to express his delight if he penetrated further
      north, into Staffordshire, Lancashire, and Yorkshire, where ugly faces and
      bad complexions are practically unknown, it is impossible to guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The City of Pleasure met with the entire approval of Pauline and Rosie. As
      soon as they found themselves in the Central Way they began to get
      enthusiastic. The sun was shining, the flags were flying, the cable-cars
      were gliding, and thousands and thousands of visitors made gay the City.
      They had never before seen anything like the Central Way, with its
      colonnades, and its shops, and its coloured throngs, and its soaring,
      gleaming, white architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as good as being abroad, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Rosie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better,&rdquo; said Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then they had never been beyond Boulogne.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stopped at shop windows, as much to regard jewellery and
      knick-knacks, as to observe whether their frocks and chiffons and hats
      were in that immaculate order which a sunny day and the presence of one&rsquo;s
      fellow-creatures demand. It may be mentioned here that their dresses were
      of dark blue, with blue belts, bunchy knots of white muslin at the throat,
      white gloves, brown glacé kid boots, and large blue-and-black picture
      hats. It was plain, but it was perfect, and they knew it was perfect. The
      consciousness of perfection enabled them to sustain the judicial gaze of
      other women, and the passing glance of innumerable young men, with a
      supercilious stare. In truth they were secretly wild with the joy of life,
      and the attractiveness of the City, and the sensations of their holiday,
      but they did not show it. Oh, no! They did not show it. They were prim to
      the most advanced degree, as became them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should just love to go on one of those dear little cable-cars!&rdquo;
       exclaimed Rosie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Pauline agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they delicious?&rdquo; said Rosie.
    </p>
    <p>
      And only in the girlish hop, skip, and jump, which landed them gracefully
      on a car, was there a hint of the pent-up vivacity which surged in their
      veins&mdash;a hint that vanished as rapidly as it had showed itself. As
      Rosie smoothed out her skirt, and as Pauline opened the purse in her
      gloved hand to give two pence to the conductor, they had the utter
      demureness of duchesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car was open to the sky, with crosswise seats, and, as it sailed
      rapidly down the Central Way, constantly passing other cars coming in the
      opposite direction, and passing fountains and flower-beds and elephants
      and camels, and all the strange world of the City, the pleasure became
      rather too keen for Rosie&rsquo;s mercurial heart. She took Pauline&rsquo;s hand and
      pressed it, sitting a little bit closer to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we meet him?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? In this crowd? Never! Besides, he isn&rsquo;t likely to be outside,&rdquo; said
      Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was only a few minutes older than Rosie, but she could not have played
      the elder sister more completely had she been ten years older.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might meet <i>her</i>, anyway!&rdquo; murmured Rosie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Rosie. You don&rsquo;t imagine she&rsquo;ll be here, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Rosie, lifting her chin. &ldquo;But suppose we do meet him,
      or either of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Pauline wisely, &ldquo;we meet them, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you speak to them?&rdquo; Rosie asked; &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll think about that when we see them,&rdquo; said Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Rosie.
    </p>
    <p>
      This exclamation had nothing to do with the foregoing chatter. It merely
      expressed some part of Rosie&rsquo;s joy when the car came to the magnificent
      circular place half-way down the Central Way, with the façade of the
      Exposition Palace on the right, the stately entrance to the Oriental
      Gardens on the left, and the superb vista of the thoroughfare before and
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Rosie again, for quite a different reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already she had forgotten the architectural and other beauties of this
      scene, and was eagerly directing Pauline&rsquo;s attention to a tall man with
      vivid hair and an individual style, who had just crossed the rails in
      front of the car and was proceeding towards the Oriental Gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Rosie, pointing frantically, yet primly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? That man with the red hair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it&rsquo;s Carpentaria, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is, I do declare!&rdquo; agreed Pauline, frankly as interested as her
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; breathed Rosie regretfully, as the car swept them further from the
      figure of the popular hero. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he look lovely? He&rsquo;s just like his
      portraits, only nicer, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t see him very well,&rdquo; said the discreet Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you could,&rdquo; Rosie corrected her sharply. &ldquo;You know you adore him.
      But you&rsquo;re always so mum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline smiled placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do wish we could meet him&mdash;be introduced to him I mean!&rdquo; said
      Rosie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; Pauline reprimanded. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly. He&rsquo;s frightfully
      rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know!&rdquo; said Rosie sadly. &ldquo;But he isn&rsquo;t married. I think his hair&rsquo;s
      beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In common with very many English and other girls, Rosie and Pauline were
      capable of displaying brazenly, for a man they had scarcely seen, an
      affection the tenth part of which certain males with whom they were
      intimately acquainted would have been delighted to receive. Their virgin
      hearts had never been touched, not even by the Apollos of the house of
      Shooter; they prided themselves on their unapproachableness; yet they
      could rave about Carpentaria, and openly profess that they were his
      slaves. In Carpentaria&rsquo;s presence they would doubtless have behaved, even
      if they did not feel, differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car whirled them to the other end of the City, and they began
      systematically to do everything and to see everything that could be done
      and seen, from the captive balloon (not that they did that&mdash;they were
      content to see it) to the Soudanese native village, from the circus to the
      exhibition relating to Woman, from the cricket field to the Freak Show,
      and from the Art Galleries to the ladies&rsquo; afternoon-tea café. They were in
      the ladies&rsquo; afternoon-tea café and paying for two pots of tea, seven
      cakes, and an extra cream, just as the clock struck five. It then occurred
      to them that a concert of military music began at precisely five o&rsquo;clock
      in the Oriental Gardens, and they decided to go and listen to it, even
      though, sad to say, Carpentaria never conducted in person till the
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      They crossed the Central Way, and were strolling along the avenue to the
      Gardens, when Pauline stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Coming down the steps of Ilam&rsquo;s bungalow was the great Ilam himself, and
      it was to Ilam she pointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; whispered Rosie. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s lots older, isn&rsquo;t he?... And
      you said we shouldn&rsquo;t meet him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked on, irresolute and blushing, and just as they arrived opposite
      Ilam&rsquo;s gate, with their eyes gazing studiously straight in front of them,
      Ilam called out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi, there! Young ladies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, the avenue was generously sprinkled with people, but Pauline and
      Rosie happened to be the only young ladies within hail, and to have
      ignored such a loud and unmistakable appeal as Ilam&rsquo;s would have drawn
      down upon them more public attention than they desired. They therefore
      stopped, still blushing, but delightfully blushing, and smiling with that
      innate kindliness of heart which distinguished both of them. Rosie spoke
      first. She was a woman, and had positively stated that under the
      circumstances she should not speak. Hence, naturally, she spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good afternoon, cousin,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her manner of pronouncing that word &ldquo;cousin,&rdquo; a non-committal manner, a
      more-than-meets-the-eye manner, a defensive manner&mdash;in a word, a
      family manner&mdash;she indicated a whole family history. When relatives
      who are distant in more senses than one meet after a considerable period,
      that particular manner is invariably employed by the one who speaks first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of the Dartmouths and the Ilams was quite simple&mdash;indeed,
      so usual as to be hardly worthy of record. Mrs. Dartmouth, mother of the
      twins, had been an Ilam. She was the orphan child of Josephus&rsquo; dead uncle,
      and therefore niece of Josephus&rsquo; father. And before her marriage she was
      understood to have &ldquo;expectations&rdquo; from that mighty and opulent soda-water
      manufacturer. However, heedless of these expectations, she went and
      married beneath her&mdash;to wit, a solicitor&rsquo;s clerk. The niece of a rich
      soda-water manufacturer has no business to marry a solicitor&rsquo;s clerk. The
      result was a complete estrangement. Mrs. Dartmouth gave all the Ilams to
      understand that she and her husband had no need of anyone&rsquo;s money&mdash;that,
      in fact, they scorned the Ilam millions. Mrs. Dartmouth met Josephus at
      his father&rsquo;s funeral. Ten years later Pauline and Rosie met Josephus at
      Mrs. Dartmouth&rsquo;s funeral. They shook hands formally, and made it clear to
      Josephus that they would stoop to accept no gift from him, who had scorned
      their mother, even should he offer it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was seven years ago, and Pauline and Rosie were now absolutely alone
      in the world, and, moreover, age had taught them tolerance, and their
      curiosity had been extremely excited by the news of their cousin&rsquo;s
      partnership with the world-renowned Carpentaria, and the subsequent birth
      of the City of Pleasure. So that, in spite of anything they might have
      previously said to each other, they were rather pleased to meet their
      solemn cousin, who, after all, was a millionaire, and who really seemed
      less aloof and stiff than he appeared at funerals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you were going to cut me?&rdquo; said Ilam, trying to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, cousin,&rdquo; said Pauline. &ldquo;How are you? You don&rsquo;t look very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands over the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mrs. Ilam. She keeps pretty well, I hope,&rdquo; put in Rosie decorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it. She doesn&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash; Won&rsquo;t you come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he opened the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you live here?&rdquo; cried Rosie. &ldquo;Fancy living in the middle of this
      place! How jolly! And what a jolly house! Oh! what a delicious notion&mdash;living
      in the show!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they disappeared into the bungalow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The historic family coolness looked as if it was going to warm itself into
      a sort of pleasant acquaintanceship.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV&mdash;Proposal of Josephus
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>es, Ilam was
      saying when they came downstairs, &ldquo;she has been like that since last
      night, and the doctors&mdash;I have had two&mdash;assure me that at her
      age no recovery is possible. She can take liquid food, and she can move
      her eyes slightly&mdash;you noticed how her eyes turn?&mdash;but otherwise
      she is incapable of movement, and, of course, she can&rsquo;t articulate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had taken his young relatives upstairs to see his mother, and the
      picture of her, lying almost in the attitude of a corpse on the bed, with
      a uniformed nurse sitting motionless beside her, had made a deep
      impression on Pauline and Rosie. In fact, the whole house saddened them.
      It was spacious and luxurious, but it was far from reaching that standard
      of splendour which one might reasonably expect from the Ilam wealth. Ilam
      did not look like a wealthy man. He did not talk like a wealthy man, and
      both girls began to perceive, dimly, that wealth is useless to those who
      have not sufficient imagination to employ it. Certainly the City of
      Pleasure was an expression of the Ilam riches, but they knew, as all the
      world knew, that the imagination which had brought into being the City of
      Pleasure was Carpentaria&rsquo;s. Hence, they felt sorry for Josephus Ilam,
      partly because of the calamity to his mother, and partly because of his
      forlorn and anxious air; they thought he wanted looking after, and that
      this heavy pompous man was greatly to be pitied, despite his opulence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told us how it happened, what caused it?&rdquo; said Pauline
      sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Ilam, &ldquo;as to that, who can tell? Probably some fright, some
      shock. But we can&rsquo;t say. She was alone when it happened. And as she can&rsquo;t
      speak&mdash;can&rsquo;t write&mdash;can&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash; Well, you see how it
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are sorry for you,&rdquo; murmured Rosie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here I am, alone as it were,&rdquo; Ilam continued. &ldquo;What am I to do? What
      can a man do by himself? I&rsquo;ve got a nurse. I can get fifty nurses, if
      necessary. And there are the servants. But what are nurses and servants?
      You understand my position, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, quite,&rdquo; said Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were partaking of a second tea in the Ilam drawing-room. The appetite
      of Rosie for cakes seemed unimpaired, though she did her best to hide it,
      and to pretend that she was only eating cakes out of politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilam swallowed his tea in great gulps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m utterly unnerved,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be,&rdquo; said Rosie kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a vast amount of superintendence to do in the City, as you may
      guess. But what am I fit for, with my poor old mother lying up there? You
      can&rsquo;t fancy what she was to me. I depended on her for everything&mdash;everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then tears showed themselves in the little eyes of Josephus Ilam. The
      appearance of those tears in the eyes of a great strong man made Rosie
      feel very uncomfortable, so much so, that she was obliged to look out of
      the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we could help you,&rdquo; said Pauline, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;d do anything we could,&rdquo; said Rosie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilam glanced up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can do everything,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hesitated to ask you, but since
      you&rsquo;ve mentioned it yourselves... and I&rsquo;ll make it worth your while. Rely
      on that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what?&rdquo; demanded Pauline, startled, while Rosie put down a fresh piece
      of cake which she had just taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and live here,&rdquo; said Ilam bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t do that, really,&rdquo; said Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not. But wouldn&rsquo;t it be lovely?&rdquo; added Rosie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Ilam. &ldquo;You are your own mistresses, aren&rsquo;t you?
      What is there to prevent you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; said Pauline judicially, &ldquo;we have our living to get, and
      then there&rsquo;s our flat, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how much you earn,&rdquo; Ilam cried. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll cheerfully
      undertake to give you treble, whatever it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be five hundred and forty-six pounds a year, then,&rdquo; said
      Rosie, who was specially good at arithmetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us say six hundred,&rdquo; Ilam amended the figure with a tremendously
      casual air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls felt that, after all, perhaps he resembled a millionaire more
      than they had at first thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, now,&rdquo; Ilam urged. &ldquo;Say yes. It&rsquo;s an idea that came to me all of a
      sudden, while I was talking to you. But it&rsquo;s an idea that gets better and
      better the more I think about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we couldn&rsquo;t give up our situations,&rdquo; objected Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Ilam asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Pauline stammered. &ldquo;It seems so queer. It&rsquo;s so sudden.
      What would our duties be here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your duties would be to act as mistresses of this house, and to look
      after my poor mother. Of course, there&rsquo;d be a nurse as well. I don&rsquo;t know
      how many servants there are&mdash;five or six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we should have to manage everything?&rdquo; said Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything domestic. Come, you agree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose,&rdquo; interpolated Rosie&mdash;&ldquo;suppose we&mdash;you&mdash;we
      didn&rsquo;t suit you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What she meant was &ldquo;Suppose you didn&rsquo;t suit us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come a month on trial,&rdquo; said Ilam. &ldquo;At the end of that time, if you want
      to leave, I&rsquo;ll guarantee you a situation quite as good as you&rsquo;re leaving.
      I can&rsquo;t say fairer than that, can I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause; the twins looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just think how I&rsquo;m fixed!&rdquo; pleaded Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say, Rosie?&rdquo; Pauline asked primly of her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Rosie, &ldquo;as cousin is in such a dilemma, and poor Mrs.
      Ilam so&mdash;so ill, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Ilam; &ldquo;you agree. Good! I&rsquo;m very much obliged to you.
      You&rsquo;re two really nice girls, and I can assure you you&rsquo;ll have a free hand
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You decide for us,&rdquo; said Pauline, smiling and reddening under Ilam&rsquo;s
      appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll begin at once, eh?&rdquo; said Ilam. &ldquo;Tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s quite out of the question,&rdquo; objected Rosie. &ldquo;We shall be
      obliged to give a month&rsquo;s notice at Shooter&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Ilam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send &lsquo;em a cheque for a month&rsquo;s salary
      instead; then they can&rsquo;t grumble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to-morrow? How will they manage without us?&rdquo; persisted Rosie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilam laughed&mdash;and it was not often that Ilam laughed. Either the
      humour of the thing must have appealed to him very strongly, or it was a
      symptom that his spirits had mightily improved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll manage without you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true they can get substitutes from the Typewriting Exchange,&rdquo; said
      Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, it was arranged that Pauline and Rosie should take one of the City
      automobiles to their flat, and return with trunks and boxes during the
      evening. Before leaving the bungalow Pauline wrote to Shooter&rsquo;s informing
      them of the blow that had fallen on Shooter&rsquo;s, and Ilam filled in a
      cheque, and Rosie put it in the envelope and fastened the envelope. The
      automobile, ordered by telephone, came round to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll introduce us to Mr. Carpentaria, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Rosie smilingly,
      as she was getting into the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilam frowned, and then cleared his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to know him?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I suppose you must,&rdquo; Ilam agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t this the greatest fun?&rdquo; Rosie whispered to Pauline when they
      drove off. &ldquo;We can go where we like in the City. We can save at least five
      hundred a year, and perhaps we shall be his heiresses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; Pauline admonished her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And three hours later those two extremely practical twins were thoroughly
      installed in the Ilam bungalow. They had the air of having lived there all
      their lives as they chatted with Ilam in the drawing-room. Ilam himself
      was decidedly looking a little better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been talking to nurse,&rdquo; said Pauline importantly, &ldquo;and I shall
      sleep on the couch in Mrs. Ham&rsquo;s room to-night. Nurse needs rest. She says
      there is nothing to do, but some one should be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to begin by tiring yourselves,&rdquo; said Ilam, &ldquo;but, of
      course&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They heard a violent ring at the front-door, and presently a servant
      entered. Ilam started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Carpentaria,&rdquo; said the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilam turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show him in,&rdquo; said Rosie calmly to the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Rose,&rdquo; said the servant, who, in common with the other
      servants, had already been clearly informed of the names, position, and
      authority of the new-comers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to introduce him to us, you know,&rdquo; Rosie murmured sweetly to
      Ilam, &ldquo;and I suppose we shall have to play hostesses now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria came in, evidently hot from his concert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Ilam&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he perceived the twins, and Ilam clumsily performed the
      introductions. The girls were enchanted with his uniform and with him. He
      said little, and he was pale, but then he was so distinguished; all his
      movements were distinguished and magnificent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We saw you this afternoon,&rdquo; Rosie ventured timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I didn&rsquo;t see you! The loss was mine,&rdquo; he returned, gazing at Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilam had sunk back heavily into a chair. Carpentaria caught sight of his
      face, and an awkward silence followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came on a matter of business,&rdquo; Carpentaria said to Ilam, &ldquo;but I won&rsquo;t
      trouble you now, it will do to-morrow. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall hope to see more of you,&rdquo; said Rosie when Carpentaria had
      demonstrated that he really meant to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes indeed,&rdquo; said Pauline very quietly, and the visitor bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Carpentaria, that glorious vision, had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin&rsquo;s nerves are simply all to pieces,&rdquo; commented Rosie, as the girls
      were going upstairs; &ldquo;even a casual visitor upsets him. Did you notice his
      face as soon as the bell rang?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI&mdash;The Box
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>auline had put the
      book down on the bed, and was bending over the fire pulling the coals
      together with the poker. She performed this homely, natural, everyday
      action more to reassure herself, to convince herself that she was in an
      everyday world, than because the fire needed attention. For the strange
      mystery of the speechless creature on the bed, helpless as though bound
      with chains and gagged by the devices of tortures, had seized and
      terrified her. She held the poker in the air and listened. Not a sound
      save the ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece! From all the sleeping
      house, not a sound. She might have been alone with the living corpse in
      the house, and yet she knew that Rosie, and Josephus Ilam, and the nurse,
      and the halfdozen servants, were in various rooms of it, perhaps sleeping,
      perhaps trying to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden sharp noise behind her, near the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started violently and glanced round in fear. It was merely the book&mdash;the
      harmless and amusing &ldquo;The Lady or the Tiger?&rdquo;&mdash;which had slipped from
      the bed to the floor. Yet how could it have slipped? Had the paralytic,
      who was incapable of the slightest movement, after all twitched a limb and
      so shaken the book off the bed? Absurd. She had merely placed the book too
      close to the edge of the bed; that was all. Nothing more natural, nothing
      more probable. Her nervous fright was grotesque.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, picked up the book, and looked again at her charge. The burning,
      blazing eyes were still dropping tears, and the tears ran in a deep furrow
      down either cheek. Softly Pauline wiped them away, her own eyes moist. The
      tragedy of the life&rsquo;s end of this old, old woman, whom every one had
      regarded as fierce and formidable, rendered helpless in a moment by no one
      knew what horrible visitation, chilled her heart&rsquo;s core.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can she want? What is troubling her?&rdquo; thought Pauline frenziedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she imagined that perhaps she had mistaken all the symptoms of
      those eyes, and that Mrs. Ilam had wished her to continue to read. She
      resumed the book, and read very slowly in a fairly loud voice. And
      instantly the eyes began to blink irregularly&mdash;fast, then slow&mdash;and
      the eyeballs themselves moved slightly from side to side. Obviously the
      patient was not content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline put down the book again in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyeballs still moved slightly to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wants something in the room. What can it be?&rdquo;&rsquo; said Pauline to
      herself. &ldquo;It may be she is thirsty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went to the night-table and poured a few drops of water into the
      invalid&rsquo;s cup, and brought it near Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s lips. But the eyes seemed
      to close as if in refusal, and the face, which could only wear one
      expression&mdash;that of grief&mdash;to deepen its inexpressible
      melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then an idea occurred to Pauline, and shone on her brow like a light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she said kindly to the aged woman. &ldquo;I will ask you some
      questions. The answers will be only yes or no. If you mean &lsquo;no&rsquo; try to
      keep your eyelids still, but if you mean &lsquo;yes&rsquo; blink them! as much as you
      can. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyelids blinked; and then they continued their terrible entranced
      stare at a spot on the ceiling exactly above their owner&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Pauline. &ldquo;Are you in pain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No movement of the eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you thirsty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slight flickering, which the patient clearly endeavoured to suppress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes blinked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it some person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyelids were steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something in this room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A violent blinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it in a drawer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyelids were steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I can see it as I stand here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes blinked again. Pauline set the cup down on the night-table, and
      gazed round the room. She went to the mantelpiece, and gave a list of the
      things on it: candlestick, clock, matches, vases, keys, medicine-bottle, a
      piece of crochet work, a long knitting-needle, a picture post-card. There
      was no response from the invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How foolish I am!&rdquo; murmured Pauline. &ldquo;She cannot possibly want any of
      these things.&rdquo; Then she saw a few old letters half-hidden behind the
      clock. &ldquo;Is it there?&rdquo; she asked, holding the letters near to Mrs. Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was still no response. She put back the letters and went to the
      ottoman, on which was a large family Bible. But it was not the Bible that
      Mrs. Ilam wanted, nor a spectacle case that lay on the Bible. Then Pauline
      catalogued one by one the contents of the dressing-table, and then the
      contents of the washstand, still with no result. At last, she came to a
      chest of drawers, covered with a piece of white crewelwork, and bearing
      some wax flowers, two small vases, a black lacquered box, sundry folded
      linen, several books, and a few faded photographs. She described the
      photographs and the linen and the books, as these seemed to be the most
      likely objects, and then she came to the lacquered box. And suddenly, the
      eyes began to blink furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want this box?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes continued to blink.
    </p>
    <p>
      She brought it to the bed: It was about eight inches square and three
      inches in depth, and beautifully inlaid with mother-of-pearl in a design
      to resemble a bunch of roses&mdash;just such a little cabinet as our
      grandmothers valued, such as was scorned as being Early Victorian during
      the aesthetic movement of the eighties and nineties, but such as we
      ourselves are beginning to recognize as beautiful. It had prominent brass
      hinges, and a keyhole, and it was locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me to open it? It&rsquo;s locked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes were moderately still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you wish it put somewhere else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They blinked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a drawer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the dressing-table?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Near you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes blinked,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under the bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No response.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline was at a loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under your pillow?&rdquo; she hazarded at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyelids moved up and down, if not with joy, at any rate with
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      And very carefully Pauline raised the pillow, and
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s head, and slipped the box underneath both the pillow and the
      bolster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There; is that right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tragic eyes blinked, and a slight sigh emanated weakly from between
      those thin pale lips. But, slight as it was, it seemed to have come from
      the innermost depths of the stricken woman&rsquo;s being. It might have been a
      sigh to indicate that her last wish was realized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall lie down now,&rdquo; said Pauline, and turning out all the electric
      lights except the tiny table lamp on the table, she stretched herself on
      the couch which stood at the foot of the great bed, and she drew a rug
      over her and shut her eyes and told herself that she must sleep. But she
      could not sleep. Her brain was as busy as the inside of a clock and
      electric lights seemed to be burning and fizzing in it, extinguishing
      themselves and relighting themselves. What strange house had she and Rosie
      wandered into? What was the hidden secret of this paralysis, and of
      Josephus Ilam&rsquo;s worn and worried mien, and of the sudden arrival and
      equally sudden departure of Carpentaria? And, above all, what was the
      meaning of the old woman&rsquo;s desire for the box. What was in the box?
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not imagine that Pauline regretted having come. She did not. Except
      under the passing influences of night and of the presence of illness, she
      was not a bit superstitious; nor was Rosie. They were not afraid of
      mysteries. They were intensely practical young women, incapable of being
      frightened or repulsed by what they did not understand. And that Pauline
      was a girl entirely without the timidity of the doe, she abundantly proved
      in the next few minutes. As she lay on the couch she could see, without
      moving her head, the French window. She fancied that the heavy crimson
      curtain was somewhat pulled aside in one place, at a height of about four
      feet from the ground, and she fancied that she could see the end of a
      finger on the end of the curtain. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;this is
      ridiculous. There cannot possibly be a finger there. I must not be silly,&rdquo;
       and she resolutely shut her eyes. The next time she opened them, the fire
      had blazed up a little and, more than ever, the something on the edge of
      the curtain resembled a finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her little heart beating, but courageously, she noiselessly rose up from
      the couch and approached the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the end of a finger on the edge of the curtain&mdash;a finger with
      a rounded and very white finger-nail I Moreover, the curtain trembled
      slightly, as it would do if held by some one who was endeavouring not to
      move. Pauline remembered that the French window behind the curtain had
      purposely been left slightly open, and that it gave on to a balcony, as
      most of the windows of the bungalow did.
    </p>
    <p>
      She advanced resolutely, and drew aside the curtain.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII&mdash;The Man on the Balcony
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> man was standing
      behind it. The French window had been opened at least eight inches, and
      the man stood partly in the aperture and partly in the room. He did not
      flinch. He did not even seem scared, nor yet disturbed. He was a
      middle-aged man, with grey hair, and a worn, rather sad face, and he wore
      a blue suit of clothes, which showed earth-stains and other evidences of
      an exciting and violent life. He was, in fact, the man whom Ilam had
      buried, and who described himself to Carpentaria as Mr. Jetsam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; demanded Pauline, in a low, brave voice. &ldquo;What
      do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She mastered her fear, though her heart was beating madly. She determined
      that, just as she had proved equal to difficult situations in the past,
      she would prove equal to this one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that you have seen me, I want to talk to you,&rdquo; replied the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You climbed up by the balcony, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the intruder. &ldquo;Nothing more simple. I found a ladder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you had better go as you came&mdash;and quickly!&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the alternative?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I must call the master of the house. In any event I shall do
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Jetsam. &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t call Jos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jos!&rdquo; repeated Pauline, astounded at this familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said &lsquo;Jos,&rsquo;&rdquo; the man insisted firmly. &ldquo;What do you take me for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally I take you for a burglar. What else should you be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, do I look like a burglar?&rdquo; Mr. Jetsam asked severely. &ldquo;Examine me,
      and tell me whether I look like a burglar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever you are,&rdquo; said Pauline, in a tone of decision, &ldquo;I cannot remain
      talking to you like this. I am in charge of an invalid here, and you must
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man gazed at her fixedly. She thought his eyes were very sad eyes, and
      yet dignified, too. They reminded her of the eyes of Mrs. Ilam. And
      presently, when they grew moist, they reminded her even more of the eyes
      of Mrs. Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Dartmouth,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I can easily prove to you that I am not a
      burglar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know of you. I know your name. I know you by sight. I know that you and
      your sister have come into this stricken and fatal house from sheer
      goodness of heart!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not talk like that,&rdquo; said Pauline, whom any praise, save of her
      personal appearance, made extremely uncomfortable. She endeavoured to make
      her voice cold, forbidding, and accusatory, but she could not. The eyes of
      the grey-haired man seemed to hypnotize her, to rob her of initiative, and
      of the power to decide things for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will talk in any manner you like,&rdquo; returned Mr. Jetsam, &ldquo;provided you
      will let me come into the room and explain to you what I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why impossible? It is, on the contrary, perfectly easy,&rdquo; said Mr. Jetsam.
      &ldquo;All I have to do is to close the window&rdquo;&mdash;and he closed it&mdash;&ldquo;to
      come into the room&rdquo;&mdash;and he came in&mdash;&ldquo;and to ask you to be good
      enough to listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put down his felt hat on a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now stood within the room, a couple of feet from Pauline, in the
      direction of the bed, but with his back to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline, with a sudden sharp movement, darted to the mantelpiece, by the
      side of which was the bell-push. In the same instant he, too, darted
      forward and clutched her wrist, just as she was about to touch the bell.
      They held themselves rigid for a moment, like statues.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand your feelings,&rdquo; said Mr. Jetsam in a shaken voice. &ldquo;I admire
      you. But before you ring that bell, let me assure you most solemnly that
      if you do ring it you will bring murder into this house. You will utterly
      ruin one family, if not two. Believe what I say; you cannot help but
      believe it. A man&rsquo;s character for truthfulness shows itself in every
      accent of his voice, and by this time, you must be very well aware that
      when I speak, I speak the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline moved from the mantelpiece and he loosed her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not know it, but she was breathing very rapidly through her nose,
      and her charming nostrils were distended. Still, she probably noticed the
      admiration in Mr. Jetsam&rsquo;s glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Dartmouth,&rdquo; he began, and then stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously they both thought of the invalid stretched moveless on the
      bed, and Pauline bent over that form. The eyes blinked irregularly, and
      always they stared up at the same point of the ceiling. They were dry, but
      Pauline noticed traces of tears on the rugged cheeks, and she wiped them
      away&mdash;it was her mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t advise me what I ought to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then she faced Mr. Jetsam once more, still standing by the bed. The
      table-lamp, with the crimson silk shade, and the bright fire gave
      sufficient light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Dartmouth,&rdquo; Mr. Jetsam recommenced, &ldquo;a great crime was committed
      long ago in the Ilam family, one of the most cruel crimes conceivable. It
      can never be atoned for in full, or nearly in full: but, even now, after
      many, many years, it can be partially atoned for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who committed this crime? and what was it? Murder?&rdquo; gasped Pauline in a
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot be sure who committed it,&rdquo; replied the man; &ldquo;and it was not
      murder. It was worse than murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know it was worse than murder? How does it concern you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was the victim,&rdquo; said the man quietly. And then he raised his voice and
      repeated: &ldquo;I was the victim. I am the victim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she warned him. &ldquo;Not so loud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the bed with a strange expression on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not so loud?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;She can hear, even if we speak in a
      whisper. She has heard everything, and she can do nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke bitterly, and held a pointing finger at the old woman. And her
      eyes remained ever fixed, blinking irregularly, regardless of the two
      beings near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are cruel,&rdquo; said Pauline. &ldquo;You torture her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far from being cruel,&rdquo; said Mr. Jetsam, &ldquo;I am kind. Justice is always
      kind, for it alone produces peace, and peace alone produces happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not talk like that if you had ever been happy,&rdquo; said Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have not been happy, it is because justice has been denied me. If
      this old woman and her son have never been happy it is because they have
      denied me justice. But justice may now be done, and you yourself may be
      the first instrument of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me how,&rdquo; said Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be the blind instrument,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me how,&rdquo; Pauline repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been watching a long time at that window,&rdquo; said the man, always
      with the utmost respect&mdash;&ldquo;and what I saw convinces me that you know
      more of this affair than you care to seem to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded the girl defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Jetsam, &ldquo;Mrs. Ilam cannot talk, cannot give instructions
      of any kind. Yet I saw you take a particular box from off the chest of
      drawers, and hide it under the invalid&rsquo;s pillow. In order to hide it, you
      actually disturbed the invalid. You lifted her head to enable you to
      conceal the box in the bed beneath it. That is strange, Miss Dartmouth.
      But I have no desire to pry into your secrets. You are a friend of the
      family, nay more, a relative, and you had the right to do all that you
      have done. But let me tell you at once that I have come in search of
      precisely that box. I hoped to get it while everybody was asleep; but I
      was prepared for emergencies. If your cousin Ilam had been here in your
      place I should have obtained possession of it without asking his leave.
      But you&mdash;well, I humbly ask you to give it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline gazed at the poor organism on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he to have the box?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Is he to have the box, Mrs. Ilam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The staring, sad eyes did not move. There was not the slightest flutter of
      the lids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you put questions to her?&rdquo; asked Mr. Jetsam moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She means that you are not to have the box,&rdquo; said Pauline, and then she
      addressed Mrs. Ilam anew. &ldquo;You mean that he is to go away without the
      box?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyelids wavered and then blinked rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; You must now go&mdash;at once. I have listened to you
      too long,&rdquo; said Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible that you should refuse me,&rdquo; argued the man. &ldquo;Impossible!
      I don&rsquo;t suppose that motion of the eyelids means anything, but even if it
      did, naturally she does not want me to have the box. Still, I must have
      it. Miss Dartmouth, everything depends on my obtaining that box. Its
      contents are essential to the bringing about of justice. I entreat you
      most urgently and most solemnly to give it to me. You cannot doubt my
      sincerity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will admit frankly,&rdquo; answered Pauline, &ldquo;that I do not doubt your
      sincerity. But, all the same, you cannot have that box&mdash;at least from
      my hands. It belongs to Mrs. Ilam; she evidently treasures it highly. I
      put it under her pillow to satisfy her. Mrs. Ilam is helpless, and I am in
      charge of her. You must go, I repeat&mdash;and at once. We have talked too
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I take it by force?&rdquo; suggested the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would never dare,&rdquo; said Pauline angrily, and she rushed again to the
      bell. &ldquo;If you attempt to take it I will ring the bell, and I will hold you
      till some one comes, even if I die for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mad creature!&rdquo; he exclaimed acidly. &ldquo;I could kill you. It is almost worth
      while; but I won&rsquo;t. You tell me to go, and I go; but my resources are not
      yet exhausted. Good-night. I can&rsquo;t leave without expressing the opinion
      that you&rsquo;ve got both sense and grit, and plenty of both. But you&rsquo;ve made a
      mistake to-night. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And while she stood with her hand on the bell-push Mr. Jetsam passed very
      calmly out of the window, and the curtain fell in front of him and hid
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the most curious adventure of Pauline&rsquo;s life, which, indeed, had
      hitherto been entirely free from the unusual and the mysterious. After a
      short period of hesitation she went to the window, drew aside the curtain
      boldly, and looked out into the night of the City. There was no sign of
      her late visitor, but the ladder rested against the balcony, a proof of
      his recent presence; otherwise, she might have persuaded herself that what
      she had been through was a dream. She shut the window and bolted it, and
      came back into the room. The old woman, with her dark burning eyes staring
      always at the same spot on the ceiling, seemed now somewhat easier.
      Pauline gazed at her, and, after having stirred the fire, lay down again
      on the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as she closed her eyes, the strange enigma of Mrs. Ilam and her son
      and the nocturnal visitant filled her mind with distracting and futile
      thoughts. Who was this grey-haired man, at once so masterful, so
      dignified, and so desperate? What could be the justice that he demanded?
      what the contents of the lacquered box? She would have a real good talk
      with Rosie in the morning. That prospect comforted her. Rosie&mdash;Rosie&mdash;&mdash;
      Suddenly she started, and gradually she perceived that she had been asleep
      a long time&mdash;two hours, perhaps&mdash;and that something, some
      presence, had wakened her. Looking round, she noticed that the door, which
      had been closed, was now open.
    </p>
    <p>
      She jumped up and went out of the room to the passage, but she could
      neither see nor hear anything. Then, as her eyes became accustomed to the
      obscurity, she detected a very faint, thin pencil of light at the other
      end of the passage, and on approaching it she found that it came from her
      sister&rsquo;s room. She crept forward, pushed open the door and went in. Rosie,
      fully dressed, was sitting on a chair near the window, which was not quite
      closed, and her face was hidden in her hands, and she appeared to be
      crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosie,&rdquo; exclaimed Pauline, &ldquo;whatever&rsquo;s the matter? Why aren&rsquo;t you in bed
      and asleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Rosie subsided into her sister&rsquo;s arms, weeping violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been to bed at all,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never slept in a
      room with a balcony before, and I couldn&rsquo;t resist going out on to this
      balcony to see how beautiful the night was. And I began to think what a
      splendid time we were having, and I watched the stars, and I heard the
      clock strike in the tower over there, and the gardens looked so beautiful
      in the starlight, and a long, long time must have passed. And then I saw a
      man standing under my window. He was a man dressed in blue, with grey
      hair, and he began to talk to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why didn&rsquo;t you tell him to go away, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seemed so sad, and he said such interesting things. Pauline, darling,
      there&rsquo;s something very, very wrong in this house&mdash;some mystery! He
      told me. No one could help believing what he says, and he has such a
      beautiful voice. I cried, almost, in listening to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he must be some relative,&rdquo; said Rosie. &ldquo;I think so. He didn&rsquo;t
      say. What he did say was that there was a black box which it was
      absolutely necessary he must have. Oh, Pauline, I&rsquo;m sure he isn&rsquo;t a thief!
      He&rsquo;s a man who has suffered a great deal, and he asked me to get the box
      for him, and his face was so sad&mdash;well, I said I would. And he told
      me exactly where it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did he say it was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said it was under Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s pillow; and it was, true enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; cried Pauline, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I crept into your room, and lifted Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s head, and took the box.
      You were fast asleep. He asked me to see if you were asleep, and, if you
      were, not to wake you. So I came as quietly as a mouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you obeyed him like that?&rdquo; murmured Pauline, astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I felt so sorry for him. And his voice was so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosie!&rdquo; said Pauline. &ldquo;You used to be sensible enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it!&rdquo; moaned Rosie again.

      CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;An Arrangement for a Marriage
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>uliette D&rsquo;Avray
      had a small sitting-room of her own in the Carpentaria bungalow. It was on
      the first floor, and it looked west, whereas Carpentaria&rsquo;s study and
      bedroom both looked north, on the avenue. Three days after the affair of
      the black box, Carpentaria ran hastily up the stairs of his house and
      touched the knob of the door of Juliette&rsquo;s sitting-room, and then he drew
      back his hand, nervous and hesitant. He was evidently perturbed, and he
      pulled his fine beard in a series of quick twitches, and then he rapped
      smartly on the door and coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juliette!&rdquo; he cried. He was very much surprised to discover that he had
      not got complete control of his voice. It broke in the middle of his
      half-sister&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;I must do better than this,&rdquo; he thought, trying to
      command himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juliette!&rdquo; he cried again, more firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word was scarcely out of his mouth when the door opened wide, and
      Juliette stood before him. They gazed at each other for a fraction of a
      second, as if inimically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come in, Carlos?&rdquo; she murmured softly, and her eyes fell,
      &ldquo;instead of knocking and making such a noise. What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria was certainly astonished at the nature and tone of her remark.
      She seemed to wish to run away. Then he gathered himself together, with an
      immense show of force, as a man will when confronted by a woman who is
      helpless before him, but of whom he is afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to come in,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know why,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she asserted; and she laughed&mdash;a curt laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promised me you wouldn&rsquo;t see Ilam again at present,&rdquo; said Carpentaria
      stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juliette tossed ever so little her charming head, with its admirable
      coiffure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; she admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, &ldquo;he is at this moment in the sitting-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Juliette&rsquo;s dainty nostrils began to dilate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carlos,&rdquo; she said disdainfully, &ldquo;do you know what you are saying? To me!
      Mr. Ilam is not here. I have already asked you to come in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, &ldquo;but you don&rsquo;t make way for me. You keep well in
      the doorway, Juliette!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved aside with a gesture of the finest feminine scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there space for you to enter?&rdquo; she said, bitterly sarcastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria stepped forward one pace. His foot was on the door-mat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a moment, Carlos,&rdquo; she said warningly, lifting her arm. &ldquo;I repeat
      that Mr. Ilam is not here. I cannot imagine what put the idea into your
      head. But whatever put it in, let me advise you to put it out again at
      once. Under the circumstances, if you come into this room, now that I have
      distinctly told you that Mr. Ilam is not here, it will be equivalent to
      calling me a liar. I could not suffer that, even from you, Carlos. I
      should leave you. We should quarrel for ever. Think what you are doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears stood in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria shuffled his feet in an agony of uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in if you doubt me,&rdquo; Juliette continued. &ldquo;But if you do, it will be
      the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria turned slowly away, and passed down the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t doubt you,&rdquo; he called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juliette made no response. She waited till her half-brother had descended
      the stairs, then she shut the door quietly, and ran to the Louis Quinze
      sofa, with its gilded borders, that stood a little way from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can come out,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And from behind the sofa emerged the bulky form of Josephus Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; he muttered, searching in his pocket for a handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juliette sat down on a chair and burst into tears. The contrast between
      their two handkerchiefs&mdash;Ham&rsquo;s enormous, like himself, and Juliette&rsquo;s
      a fragment of lace no larger than a piece of bread-and-butter&mdash;was
      one of those trifles which put an edge of the comical on the tragic stuff
      of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an astounding woman!&rdquo; exclaimed Ilam, wiping his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lied to him&mdash;I have deceived him. You heard what I said?&rdquo;
       whimpered Juliette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You behaved superbly,&rdquo; said Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I behaved shamefully,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;But I did it for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she looked at him over her handkerchief, with wet eyelashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilam would have gone through unutterable torture for her in that moment.
      It was a highly strange thing&mdash;this late coming of love into the
      existence of Josephus Ilam. It transformed him. It made him feel that, at
      fifty, he was only just beginning to grasp the meaning of life. It made
      him see that hitherto his days and his years had been wasted on vain
      things, and that the only commodity really worth having in this world was
      such a look as Juliette gave him out of her impassioned eyes. He could not
      understand what so bewitching and lively a woman as Juliette could see in
      a heavy, gloomy fellow like him. For the matter of that, probably no other
      person, save only Juliette, could understand that mystery. But then, when
      a woman loves a man, she sees him in a radiance shed from her own soul,
      and it changes him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor friend,&rdquo; said Juliette, composing herself, &ldquo;why do you put me in
      such an awkward position, coming upstairs like this, and in the middle of
      the day, too? You must have bribed one of the servants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t tell me which,&rdquo; Juliette put in quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent down and kissed her. Yes, this heavy and rather creaky person, who
      had laughed at love for several decades, bent down and kissed a pretty
      woman sitting on a Louis Quinze sofa; moreover, he put his arms round her.
      He did it clumsily, of course, but Juliette did not think so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was obliged to see you,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t go without seeing
      you. Why have you so persistently kept out of my way? You were so kind
      that morning&mdash;when Carpentaria surprised you. Has he been bullying
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Juliette, suddenly excited. &ldquo;I cannot tell you what he
      said to me. You know I love him best in the world&mdash;next to&mdash;you.
      But he said such things to me&mdash;such things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said&mdash;oh, my dearest!&mdash;he said his life was not safe&mdash;he
      said no one&rsquo;s life was safe in this City&mdash;he said he had been shot at
      in the bandstand; and, you know, that business of the milk was dreadful.
      The strange thing is that Carlos won&rsquo;t consult the police about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how does this affect us&mdash;affect you and me?&rdquo; demanded Ilam
      bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; said Juliette, &ldquo;poor Carlos thinks&mdash;he actually thinks&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I am trying to kill him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks you have something to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why? Why should I want to kill your brother&mdash;your brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; agreed Juliette. &ldquo;And why should you want to kill anybody&rsquo;s
      brother?&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said hastily. &ldquo;Why should I want to kill any person at
      all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carlos says that he is not the only person you have tried to kill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! And who is the other? Give me the full catalogue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He says you have buried a man in the grounds, and that he
      saw you do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juliette!&rdquo; Ilam stepped backwards. Then he stopped. &ldquo;Juliette,&rdquo; he
      repeated, &ldquo;I swear to you most solemnly that I have never tried to kill
      anyone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest, you shouldn&rsquo;t have said that!&rdquo; she remonstrated. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t
      have sworn to me. It is an insult to my love. Do you imagine that I
      believed Carlos for a single instant? Do you imagine it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him proudly, gloriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How splendid you are!&rdquo; muttered Josephus Ilam, son of the soda-water
      manufacturer. The admiration was drawn out of him. He had not guessed that
      women could be so fine. And then he perceived that he, too, must be
      splendid, that he must be worthy of her; and so he proceeded:
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, it is true that I did bury a man in the grounds a few
      nights ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The perspiration stood afresh on his brow as he made the confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he was dead,&rdquo; said Ilam, speaking quickly. &ldquo;I thought I should
      be accused of his murder. And so I&mdash;the fact is, I was mad. I was off
      my head. I must have been. Until yesterday I actually fancied I was being
      haunted by his ghost. Yes! me! me&mdash;thinking a thing like that! But I
      did; and yesterday I was in that big crush, during the shower, in the
      Court of the Exposition Palace, and he, too, was in the crowd. I saw him;
      I touched him; he didn&rsquo;t see me, thank Heaven! Then I knew that what I had
      buried was not a corpse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this man?&rdquo; asked Juliette calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My angel!&rdquo; said Ilam, driven to poetry by the stress of his emotion, &ldquo;you
      mustn&rsquo;t inquire; there are some things I can&rsquo;t tell you&mdash;at least,
      not yet. When we are married, when matters are settled a bit, I will tell
      you everything, but not now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not now?&rdquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you persist I shall simply go and kill myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;you do not love me as much as I love you. The
      measure of love is trust, and you do not trust me completely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you in my way,&rdquo; said Ilam doggedly; &ldquo;men are not like women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; she admitted philosophically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would tell you everything if I was free to do so,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest&rdquo;&mdash;she addressed him in quite a new tone&mdash;&ldquo;you know
      something about those attacks on Carlos&rsquo; life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with an air of absolute certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had nothing to do with them,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know something about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell from your manner,&rdquo; she said triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing for certain, nothing precise,&rdquo; said Ilam&mdash;&ldquo;nothing
      that I can tell you&mdash;nothing that I dare tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; she remarked, with a faint acidity, &ldquo;it seems to me that you
      have come here to-day in order not to tell me things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He deprecated her tone with an appealing gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you, at any rate, this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that your brother&rsquo;s life is
      no longer in danger&mdash;of that I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are atoning,&rdquo; she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is more than can be said of my life,&rdquo; Ilam proceeded, not heeding
      her smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your life is in danger?&rdquo; she questioned, rushing to him as though she
      would protect him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilam, without a word, led her to the window, from the corner of which a
      glimpse of the avenue could be caught, and walking to and fro there in the
      avenue was the Soudanese.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see that man?&rdquo; said Ilam. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fellow they call &lsquo;Spats&rsquo; in the
      native village. I don&rsquo;t know why. He is devoted to me; he is fully armed;
      he follows me everywhere. I have only to blow this whistle&rdquo;&mdash;and Ilam
      produced a whistle from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling&rdquo;&mdash;and Juliette clung to him&mdash;&ldquo;is it so bad as that? Who
      is it that threatens you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man that I buried,&rdquo; said Ilam quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ilam, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m come here to see you. We must get your brother on
      our side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll force him to understand at once,&rdquo; cried Juliette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ilam, &ldquo;perhaps you would fail, as things are, but if you were
      my wife, you would not fail then. Carpentaria, once the thing was done,
      would do everything in his power to protect your husband; he likes you
      well enough for that. He might be angry at first, but he would see
      reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest, you want me to marry you secretly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I merely want you to go with me to the registry office at Putney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that what you came for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I came for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love!&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, with that cold and penetrating insight which women have, she saw
      clearly that, though Ilam&rsquo;s idea of getting Carpentaria&rsquo;s assistance in a
      moment of grave danger was doubtless quite serious, it was somewhat
      fanciful, and that Ilam&rsquo;s professed reason for their instant marriage was
      also fanciful, and was not a real reason, but only an excuse. He merely
      wanted to marry her at once, that was all, and although his life was
      threatened, he thought little of that. She loved him the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can make the arrangements pretty quick,&rdquo; said Ilam. &ldquo;You will agree, my
      angel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she nodded, and the compact was sealed. They heard a scurrying in the
      passages of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juliette! Juliette!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Carpentaria&rsquo;s voice, and other voices mingled with it indistinctly&mdash;the
      voices of the servants. &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she answered loudly and, whispering to
      Ilam, &ldquo;Get out of the window; whistle softly for your Soudanese. You can
      get on to the roof of the outhouse. He will help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And noiselessly she opened the window, and Ilam, struck by her tremendous
      resourcefulness, passed out. She heard his low whistle, and then she ran
      to the door and into the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house is on fire,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, meeting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; she answered calmly. &ldquo;Are the firemen come? where&rsquo;s the fire?&rdquo;&mdash;She
      sniffed&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I can smell it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was amazingly calm. &ldquo;No woman with a man concealed in her
      sitting-room,&rdquo; said Carpentaria to himself, &ldquo;could behave so calmly upon
      being informed that the house was on fire. Her first thought would have
      been to secure the hidden man&rsquo;s safety.&rdquo; And Carpentaria ran downstairs
      with a great show of activity. He was baffled, disappointed, for he had
      deliberately set fire to his own house in order to drive Ilam from the
      sitting-room, where he felt sure Ilam was. And the trick had failed. After
      all, he had been mistaken. He had been convinced of his sister&rsquo;s
      deception, and lo! she had not deceived him. Carpentaria could have killed
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily the fire was of no importance, and it was extinguished before it
      had done more than about five pounds&rsquo; worth of damage and alarmed more
      than about five thousand visitors to the City.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX&mdash;The Heart of the City
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he situation of
      the heart of the City was one of the secrets of the City. It was not
      located, perhaps, exactly where you might have expected it to be, and for
      a very good reason. The magnificent building which housed the managerial,
      clerical, and inspectorial staff of the City was near the south end of the
      Central Way. It comprised four floors, and more than a hundred clerks
      spent seven hours a day there. On the first floor was the President&rsquo;s
      Parlour, where Ilam held consultations with Carpentaria and with the heads
      of departments, from the department of catering to the department of
      road-cleaning. On the floor above was the Manager&rsquo;s and Musical Director&rsquo;s
      Parlour, where the august Carpentaria held consultations with Ilam and
      with the heads of other departments, from that of music, with its
      subsections (a) open-air bands, (b) theatre and other bands, (c)
      restaurant bands, (d) vocal music, (e) pianolas, gramophones, and
      mechanical orchestras, to the procession and fêtes department. But the
      heart of the City was nowhere in this building.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were also scattered about the immense grounds, various other
      executive buildings of a smaller size, where sectional managers, viceroys
      of Ilam and Carpentaria, held their mimic sway. But the heart of the City
      was not in any of these, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very few persons, even among those on the salary-list of the City, did
      know where the heart was; for it was not talked about. Talking about it
      was discouraged; the hearts of such places are never talked about. And it
      is a most singular thing that visitors to the City scarcely gave a thought
      to the question of the situation of the heart of the City. The most
      interesting of all the many secrets of the City seldom aroused public
      curiosity, so strange is the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heart of the City, as I propose to reveal, was situated beneath the
      Storytellers&rsquo; Hall, near the northern end of the Central Way, on your left
      hand as you passed down from the north entrance-gates. The Storytellers&rsquo;
      Hall was an invention of Carpentaria&rsquo;s&mdash;one of his best. Between two
      o&rsquo;clock and four, between five o&rsquo;clock and seven, and between half-past
      eight and closing-time you could pay sixpence to go into the Storytellers&rsquo;
      Hall and listen to a succession of American and Irish and English
      performers, whose sole business it was to sit in an armchair on the
      diminutive stage and tell funny stories. The entertainment consisted in
      nothing else. It was the simplest thing in the world, and yet one of the
      completest successes of the City. It was a success from the very first
      hour of its existence. The little hall was nearly always crowded, chiefly
      by men. One is bound to admit that women were not enchanted by it; either
      they laughed in the wrong places, or they turned to their husbands,
      sweethearts, uncles, nephews, at the end of the story, and asked if that
      really was the end of the story, and, if it was, would their husbands,
      sweethearts, uncles, nephews kindly explain the joke to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the heart of the City was beneath that gay and mirthful structure.
      While storytellers told stories above the level of the ground, the most
      serious business of the City was being transacted a few feet away, below
      the level of the ground. Let me explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take an average intelligent visitor to the City. He approaches, say, the
      northern entrance, and among the twenty patent turnstiles which confront
      him he chooses the nearest one that is empty. He puts a shilling on the
      iron table of the turnstile; an official in the livery of the City
      scrutinizes the coin to make sure that it is what it pretends to be, and
      then pushes it down a little hole. The shilling disappears&mdash;not only
      from the sight, but from the thoughts of the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a highly remarkable fact&mdash;as he squeezes through the turnstile
      he actually forgets all about his shilling, forgets it for evermore!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet shillings are being poured in a continuous stream into the mouth of
      that turnstile and into the mouths of scores of similar turnstiles, all
      day. What becomes of them? Surely this question ought to interest the
      average intelligent visitor! What becomes of them? The turnstiles won&rsquo;t
      hold an unlimited number of shillings; nevertheless, shillings are falling
      into them eternally and they are never emptied; they are never even moved;
      they could not be moved, since they are imbedded in concrete. Here <i>is</i>
      a puzzle for the average intelligent visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will occur to anyone that when four hundred thousand people have each
      paid a shilling entrance, quite a nice little lot of money must have
      accumulated somewhere in the City by nightfall; for, besides the entrance
      shillings, there is the vast expenditure of the visitors after they have
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nice little bit of money runs to the heart of the City. That is what
      the heart of the City is for; that is why it is called the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the heart was a long, wide, and low apartment, lighted by
      electricity, and lined with concrete. In the centre, its top level with
      the floor, was a huge safe, which by hydraulic power could be raised till
      its top was nearly level with the ceiling, and its doors bared to the
      persuasions of keys. Round about were large wooden tables, furnished with
      large and small balances, copper scoops, bags, and steel coffers. A few
      chairs completed the apparatus of the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shillings of the clients of the City dropped through the mouths of the
      turnstiles right down to a small subterranean chamber, which could only be
      reached from a tunnel beneath each entrance. Thus, the officials in charge
      of the turnstiles had no control whatever over the coins once they had
      been slipped into the orifices. The coins were checked and collected by an
      entirely separate set of officials, who visited the underground chambers
      every three hours and brought back the booty, enclosed in coffers, in
      specially constructed insignificant-looking carriages, to the solitary
      door of the heart. And the door of the heart was by no means in the
      Central Way; it gave on a back entry running parallel to the Way and just
      wide enough to permit the passage of one carriage. The coffers were
      received, and receipted for, by an official of the heart, and handed by
      him into the interior. Neither he nor the collectors were ever allowed to
      enter the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the day of the secret interview between Juliette and
      Ilam, the inconspicuous door of the heart was guarded, not by its usual
      official, but by a tall Soudanese, and waiting close to him was an
      automobile with chauffeur on board. The automobile was one of several
      employed specially to transport the riches of the City to the head offices
      of the London and West-End Bank in King William Street. The journeys were
      made at night, twice a week, and the offices of the London and West-End
      were specially opened to receive the coin. Automobiles laden with vast
      wealth are less apt to be remarked when they travel at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the heart itself were three people&mdash;Ilam; a middle-aged man
      named Gloucester, who spent all his days in counting and weighing gold and
      silver, and who was the presiding genius of the heart; and, thirdly, a
      clerk from the London and West-End Bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gloucester was weighing sovereigns, the clerk was counting coffers and
      piling them up in a corner near the door, and Ilam was idly inspecting the
      doors of the huge safe, which had been raised out of its well and stood
      open and empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      During that day and the previous two days, what with a monster Y.M.C.A.
      fête then in progress, and what with the weather, over a million shillings
      had been taken at the turnstiles. Now, a new shilling weighs eighty-seven
      grains, and about seven thousand average current shillings go to the
      hundredweight. A million shillings, or fifty thousand pounds in silver,
      will weigh, therefore, something like seven tons. Nearly the whole of this
      treasure had already started on its way to the famous vaults of the London
      and West-End Bank; only a few coffers remained. But there was, in
      addition, about ten thousand pounds in gold, which weighed about a couple
      of hundredweight, and it was chiefly for this gold that the last
      automobile was waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven coffers of silver, Mr. Gloucester,&rdquo; said the clerk; &ldquo;two of gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be ready with the others in a few minutes,&rdquo; replied Mr.
      Gloucester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll be making out the check-sheets,&rdquo; said the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so,&rdquo; said Mr. Gloucester, who was a formal old person, and wore
      steel-rimmed spectacles. And he continued his weighing of the gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this interesting and dazzling juncture, the unique door of the
      apartment, an affair of solid Bessemer steel, swung slowly on its hinges,
      and disclosed the figure of a man in a blue suit, with grey hair under his
      soft hat. Mr. Gloucester, being just a little short-sighted and just a
      little hard of hearing, neither saw nor heard the visitor. Nor did Mr.
      Ilam, who was actually within the safe, measuring its-shelves. But the
      bank-clerk, who was quite close to the door, most decidedly did see the
      man. And the clerk started, whether with fear, surprise, or mere
      nervousness, will probably never be known.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the other end of the room,&rdquo; said the man commandingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ilam!&rdquo; the clerk called out respectfully, alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the other end of the room,&rdquo; repeated the man.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk perceived then that he had a revolver. Mr. Gloucester also
      perceived the man and his revolver, and Mr. Ilam came out of the safe
      rather like a jack out of a box.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX&mdash;What Jetsam Wanted
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ullo, Jos! said
      the intruder in a light, careless and rather scornful tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a stroke of genius on his part to address Mr. Ilam as &ldquo;Jos.&rdquo; That
      curt and familiar monosyllable, directed like a bullet at the formidable
      Ilam, the august President of the City, made such an impression upon both
      Mr. Gloucester and the L. and W. E. Bank-clerk that they took no part
      whatever in the immediately subsequent proceedings. They were astounded
      into silence. They trembled lest lightning should descend and utterly
      destroy the intruder.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ilam himself was plainly at a loss. He was about to say to the
      intruder: &ldquo;You have no right to speak to me in such a way,&rdquo; and to order
      him out of the place, when the ridiculousness of protesting and the
      futility of ordering presented themselves vividly to his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, there was the revolver.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mr. Ilam said merely, in a sort of pained surprise:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jetsam!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Jetsam.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the imperturbable fellow, with his grey hair and his shabby suit and
      his weary eyes, nonchalantly sat down on the edge of one of the
      counting-tables, his legs dangling, and his body leaning forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two employés were by this time convinced that the new-comer must be
      either the Shah of Persia in disguise, or else some extremely intimate and
      life-long friend of Ilam&rsquo;s, perhaps richer than Ilam himself. The
      bank-clerk knew by sight several chairmen of banks who were quite as badly
      dressed as the man on the table. Nevertheless, they did not carry
      revolvers. The revolver was certainly rather disquieting. However, they
      bent to their work, as though both eyes of the Recording Angel were upon
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilam closed the door of the safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doorkeeper let you pass?&rdquo; he ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not at all,&rdquo; replied Jetsam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t at his post?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not just at the moment. I&rsquo;ve had him removed for a bit. He&rsquo;ll doubtless
      return as soon as I&rsquo;ve gone. I thought it would be simpler to have my own
      doorkeeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did the Soudanese say, though?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which Soudanese?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Soudanese who is outside the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, him? He didn&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a serious breach of rules for you to be here, you know,&rdquo; said
      Ilam. &ldquo;And I must ask you to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t go just yet,&rdquo; said Jetsam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Jetsam; &ldquo;except nursing this revolver. I&rsquo;m going to do
      something soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both the bank-clerk and Mr. Gloucester looked up. They even went so far as
      to glance at their employer for instructions; but their employer seemed to
      avoid the eyes of the underlings. Then Mr. Gloucester spoke in a low tone
      to the clerk, and the clerk replied, and some bags of gold were bundled
      into a coffer and the coffer locked and double-locked, and the bank-clerk
      murmured respectfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are the lot, sir. Shall I take them and go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you help me?&rdquo; said the clerk to Mr. Gloucester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Gloucester.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Gloucester and the clerk each picked up several coffers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, sir,&rdquo; said the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; said Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; Jetsam exclaimed, turning his head slowly behind him to
      follow the movements of the pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon?&rdquo; murmured the clerk interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I told you to go to the other end of the room,&rdquo; thundered
      Jetsam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mr. Ilam&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the other end of the room, up there at that corner,&rdquo; Jetsam
      commanded sternly, adding, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll blow your idiotic brains out! Do you
      hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk was in love with a girl who lived with her mother in a pretty
      little semi-detached villa at Weybridge. He thought of her; he thought of
      all the evenings he had spent with her; he conjured her up in all her
      different dresses; he heard her voice in all its tones&mdash;and all this
      in the fraction of a second. Then he put down the boxes and discreetly
      betook himself to the corner indicated by Mr. Jetsam, thinking obscurely
      and slangily that to be a bank-clerk was not all jam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, too!&rdquo; ordered Jetsam, raising a finger to Mr. Gloucester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gloucester was not in love with a charming young thing at Weybridge.
      He never had been in love; he had never lived with anyone except himself
      and a bull-terrier; but he was fond of playing chess at night at
      Simpson&rsquo;s; and he suddenly saw Simpson&rsquo;s and the chess-boards, and the
      foamy quart, and the bull-terrier lying under the table. Life and
      Simpson&rsquo;s seemed infinitely precious to him in those instants. And he put
      down his boxes and followed the bank-clerk to the suggested corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must really&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began protestingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; exploded Mr. Jetsam; and there was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must picture the large, low room, with its concrete lining and its
      half-dozen sixteen candle-power electric lights burning in the ceiling;
      and underneath these lights the four men&mdash;Ilam leaning against the
      gigantic safe which rose out of the floor in the middle of the apartment;
      Jetsam still nonchalantly swinging his legs as he sat on the table, facing
      him directly; and the democracy, somewhat scared and undecided, in a
      corner. Jetsam had his back to the door, and since the two piles of
      coffers were near the door they were out of his field of vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jetsam winked at Ilam&mdash;deliberately winked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simple as a, b, c, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he pleasantly remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m doing now&mdash;holding up a strong room and its staff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll suffer for this,&rdquo; said Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That remains to be seen,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I gravely doubt if I shall
      suffer for it. Up to now, what have I done? I have asked those gentlemen
      to go into a corner and not to indulge in desultory and disturbing
      conversation; and they have been good enough to humour my caprice; and I
      have winked at you, Jos. Is there anything illegal in winking at you? A
      few days ago you did more than wink at me&mdash;you nearly killed me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; said Ilam. &ldquo;I have an appointment&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me advise you not to move,&rdquo; Jetsam warned him, raising the revolver
      an inch or so. &ldquo;It mightn&rsquo;t be very good for your constitution. You must
      grasp, the fact that you are being held up. A worn-out operation, you will
      say&mdash;a trick lacking in novelty! Yes; but one, nevertheless, based on
      the fundamental human instincts, and therefore pretty certain to succeed.
      Indeed, I am surprised how simple it is. You might fancy from my easy
      bearing that I had devoted a lifetime to holding people up. Not in the
      least. I have never held anyone up before. And yet, how well I am
      succeeding! The thing works like a charm; merely because you can see in my
      eye that I mean to be obeyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you want money?&rdquo; said Ilam savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want impudence!&rdquo; retorted Jetsam. &ldquo;Apologize, if you please, my
      friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t what you said&mdash;it&rsquo;s your manner of saying it that was
      unworthy of you. You mean to apologize for wounding my feelings, don&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo; Jetsam smiled. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t move; merely express your regret!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; muttered Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&mdash;you see!&rdquo; cried Jetsam to the men in the corner. &ldquo;Let that be
      a lesson to you. And remember, that only great men like Mr. Ilam have
      sufficient moral force, when they are in the wrong, to admit the fact.
      Well, Jos, I accept your apology in the cheerful and generous spirit in
      which you offer it; and I shall not deny that I do want money. That is
      part of what I came for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you want?&rdquo; asked Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jetsam. &ldquo;How much have you got handy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ilam intimated that there was a small sum in gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand in gold?&rdquo; queried Jetsam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilam nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably more,&rdquo; Jetsam commented. &ldquo;But a thousand will suffice me. If I
      need a fresh supply I can always come again, can&rsquo;t I? And besides, all
      that is yours is mine, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ilam maintained silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; repeated Jetsam persuasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; growled Ilam, and his eye caught the eye of the young bank-clerk by
      pure accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the young bank-clerk, fired by martial valour, a thirst for
      glory, and the thought of what a splendid thrilling tale he would have to
      tell to the charming young thing at Weybridge, sprang furiously forward in
      the direction of Jetsam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said Jetsam, slipping off the table and facing the youth, revolver
      ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth hesitated for the fifth of a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the youth, and came on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jetsam fired almost point-blank at the hero&rsquo;s face, and the hero started
      back and sank to the ground. And there was a great hush in the room and a
      smell of powder and a little smoke. The youth lay still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; said Jetsam fiercely. &ldquo;Get up, or I&rsquo;ll kick you up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, strange to relate, the youth discovered the whereabouts of his limbs
      and got up, and returned to the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A singular example of what imagination will do!&rdquo; commented Jetsam. &ldquo;The
      first chamber of this revolver was loaded with blank. I expected to have
      to use it for theatrical effect, to begin with, and I was not wrong. Let
      me add that the other five chambers are most carefully loaded, and that I
      once earned my living in a music-hall by shooting the pips out of cards
      with this revolver.&rdquo; He then addressed Mr. Gloucester. &ldquo;Now, old man,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;how much gold is there in one of those boxes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two thousand five hundred!&rdquo; answered Mr. Gloucester politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it weighs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About sixty pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t worth while breaking into it,&rdquo; said Jetsam smoothly, looking at
      Ilam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the lot. In our final settlement it shall be brought into
      account.&rdquo; His glance shifted to Gloucester. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;for
      this information so courteously given.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are satisfied now!&rdquo; said Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go? You think you won&rsquo;t get caught, but you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, you won&rsquo;t give me away, Jos!&rdquo; protested Jetsam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced
      you won&rsquo;t; because you see, if you begin to talk about me I should
      probably begin to talk about you, and think how dreadful that would be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep it up! Keep it up!&rdquo; said Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hence,&rdquo; Jetsam proceeded, ignoring the interruption, &ldquo;I shall confidently
      rely on you to see that these excellent gentlemen here in the corner keep
      their elegant mouths shut. I shall rely on you for that. You understand,
      gentlemen, Mr. Ilam wishes you not to prattle, even in the privacy of your
      own homes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going?&rdquo; said Ilam doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jetsam; &ldquo;and so are you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you. The money is a mere incidental. What I came for was your
      distinguished self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not coming with you. I haven&rsquo;t the slightest intention of coming with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may not have much intention, but you are coming,&rdquo; said the suave
      Jetsam. &ldquo;Besides, who is going to carry this box outside for me? I can&rsquo;t
      carry the box and a revolver, too. Obviously Providence has designated
      precisely you to carry this box. Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I!&rdquo; Ilam defied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; repeated Jetsam. &ldquo;I have a vehicle awaiting outside, and we shall
      see what we shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; insisted Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jetsam advanced two paces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said he angrily and yet calmly. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t come, I&rsquo;ll shoot
      you where you stand. You ought to be able to perceive that I mean what I
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ilam&rsquo;s reply was a mute surrender. He dropped his eyes, and the next
      moment the two underlings had the spectacle of the corpulent Mr. Ilam
      lifting a sixty-pound weight and struggling with it to the door, followed
      by the revolver and Mr. Jetsam behind the revolver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop in the doorway a second,&rdquo; ordered Jetsam. He addressed the clerks
      again. &ldquo;If I were you, I shouldn&rsquo;t hurry out of here. You might catch
      cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then they saw Ilam disappear, the box in his arms, and Mr. Jetsam
      follow him. Mr. Jetsam closed the door. The clerks were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of all the&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; exclaimed the younger man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how soon it will be safe for us to leave!&rdquo; said Mr. Gloucester.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI&mdash;Interrupting a Concert
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hat evening the
      nightly concert of the &ldquo;Carpentaria Band&rdquo; was held in the great court of
      the Exposition Palace, partly because the weather was threatening, and
      partly because the Y.M.C.A. wished it so. The stalwart members of the
      Y.M.C.A. were prominent and joyous, and they pervaded the City to the
      number of some fifty thousand. They were nearly all young, and they were
      all, without exception, enthusiastic. They had taken possession of
      practically the whole of the tables on the three tiers of balconies that
      surrounded the court, and there was also a considerable sprinkling of them
      on the ground floor. They liked Carpentaria; they liked his music; they
      liked his way of conducting. They admired him when he split the drums of
      their ears, and they equally admired him when he wooed those organs with a
      hint of sound that was something less than a whisper. They violently
      cheered his marches, and with the same violence they cheered his serenades
      and his cradlesongs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently Carpentaria was content. He was more than content&mdash;he
      glowed with pleasure. He was the centre of the vast illuminated court,
      with its ornate architecture, and its wonderful roof, and its serried rows
      of lights. All eyes were centred on him. He swayed not only his band, but
      the multitude, by a single movement of the slim baton&mdash;that magic bit
      of ivory which he held in his hand. He said to himself that he had never
      had a better, a more appreciative and enthusiastic audience in the whole
      of his glorious career. The result was, that-he conducted in his most
      variegated and polychromatic manner. He did things with his wand that no
      conductor had ever done with a wand before; he performed gyrations,
      contortions, and acrobatics beyond all his previous exploits. In a word,
      he surpassed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in the very act of surpassing himself, in his renowned &ldquo;Cockney
      Serenade,&rdquo; when he observed, out of the tail of his eye, a middle-aged
      man, who was forcing his way at all costs across the floor of the hall
      towards the bandstand.
    </p>
    <p>
      When seven thousand people are packed on chairs on a single floor, it is
      not the quietest task in the world to penetrate through them. And the
      middle-aged man was not doing it quietly, in fact, he was making decidedly
      more noise than the &ldquo;Cockney Serenade,&rdquo; and attracting quite as much
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      A number of ardently musical young men on the grand balcony leaned over
      the wrought-iron parapet and advised the middle-aged man to lie down and
      die, in a manner unmistakably ferocious. (It is extraordinary how
      ferocious a youth can be on mere lemonade.) But the middle-aged man
      continued his course, and he arrived at the bandstand, despite official
      and unofficial protests, simultaneously with the conclusion of the
      serenade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gales of applause swept about the court, and Carpentaria bowed, and bowed
      again&mdash;bowed innumerably, all the time regarding the middle-aged man
      with angry and suppressed curiosity. The middle-aged man had lifted up a
      hand and pulled the triangle-player by the belt of his magnificent
      uniform, and the triangle-player had bent down to speak to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? What is it?&rdquo; asked Carpentaria, his nerves on edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A person insists on speaking to you, sir,&rdquo; replied the triangle-player.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cannot,&rdquo; snapped Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he shall,&rdquo; said the triangle-player.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Carpentaria began an anathema, and then stopped. He
      went to the rail of the bandstand and leaned over to the middle-aged man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your age,&rdquo; he said grimly, &ldquo;you ought to know better than to interrupt
      my concerts in this way. Who are you? What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Gloucester, sir,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Doubtless you recollect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in charge of the&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Here Gloucester stood up on
      tiptoe in an endeavour to whisper directly into Carpentaria&rsquo;s ear&mdash;&ldquo;the
      strong-rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; asked Carpentaria, &ldquo;what do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been robbed, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Heavens, man!&rdquo; Carpentaria exploded. &ldquo;You come to interrupt my
      concert because the strong-rooms have been robbed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two thousand five hundred pounds, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s two thousand times two thousand five hundred pounds.
      Go away! Go and worry Mr. Ilam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it, sir. Mr. Ilam has been taken, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time the multitudinous eyes of the audience were fixed on
      Carpentaria and his interlocutor, and everybody was sapiently saying to
      everybody else that something extraordinary must have occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;Mr. Ilam been taken?&rdquo; Carpentaria demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been carried off&mdash;he carried the money off&mdash;he was forced
      to, sir. Revolver, sir. Can&rsquo;t you come, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I come? Ye gods! Man, do you know what a concert is? Can I come? Of
      course I can&rsquo;t come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ilam may be dead, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have leisure to bury him after the concert,&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
      &ldquo;Go away. Go and consult Lapping, head of the police department. Or,
      rather, don&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ll upset the audience making your way out. Sit down.
      Sit right down there, and don&rsquo;t move. We&rsquo;re going to play my new
      arrangement of the &lsquo;Glory Song&rsquo; with variations. You&rsquo;ll see it will bring
      the house down. It will be something you&rsquo;ll remember as long as you live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; pleaded Mr. Gloucester pathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down&mdash;and listen,&rdquo; Carpentaria repeated sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to the centre of his men. He rapped the magic wand on his
      desk, and the next moment the band had burst deliriously into the now
      famous orchestral arrangement of the &ldquo;Glory Song.&rdquo; The audience was
      thrilled by the waves of sound that emanated from the instruments,
      especially when the variations began. So the entertainment continued,
      while Mr. Gloucester, consuming his middle-aged impatience as best he
      could, ruminated upon the strange caprices of employers. He had been an
      employé all his life; he had never commanded; and his conclusion, at the
      age of fifty odd, was to the effect that the nature of employers is
      incomprehensible, and that you never know what they will do next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, sir.&rdquo; He timidly touched Carpentaria when the concert was
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria, it appeared, in the rush and fever of the music, had
      forgotten all about him, and was on the point of leaving the court
      deafened by applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;That thief. Two thousand five hundred
      pounds. And you say that Mr. Ilam has been carried off. Tell me all about
      that. Come this way. Come into the street&mdash;it is always the most
      private place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in the Central Way, near the fountain, upon which coloured lights were
      reflected from below, Mr. Gloucester related in detail to Carpentaria the
      episode of the theft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say it was a man dressed in blue, with grey hair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there were three of you, including Mr. Ilam, and you could not manage
      to disarm him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might have meant death for the first of us, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Carpentaria absently, &ldquo;what if it did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gloucester grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said I was to consult Mr. Lapping, sir. Shall we go there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, &ldquo;not yet. I will look into it myself first. The
      principal mystery is that of the doorkeeper. What is his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wiggins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he has disappeared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was not there when I left, sir. And he could not have been there when
      the thief entered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he would not have allowed the thief to enter, sir. He has strict
      orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Come along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They hastened up the Central Way, in a northerly direction. The rain had
      kept off, and the illuminations, which were superb, evidently met with the
      ecstatic approval of the Y.M.C.A. adherents, who paraded to and fro, and
      filled the flying cars, with the hectic enjoyment of people who feel that
      closing time is near. The progress made by Carpentaria and his companion
      was therefore not of the quickest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than an hour since,&rdquo; said Mr. Gloucester, daring to show his.
      discontent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is?&rdquo; asked Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since the crime occurred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fellow must have calculated on my concert,&rdquo; replied Carpentaria. &ldquo;He
      probably knew that everybody in this City runs to me when the slightest
      thing goes wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The slightest thing!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Gloucester bitterly&mdash;but not
      aloud, only in his secret soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hurried round by the side of the Storytellers&rsquo; Hall, and so to the
      passage at the back. And standing at the entrance to the vaults,
      underneath a solitary jet of electric light, was Wiggins, the doorkeeper
      of the heart of the City. He was a man aged about thirty-five, six feet
      two high, and not quite so broad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; exclaimed Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been since&mdash;since Mr. Ilam arrived here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did what you told me, sir,&rdquo; said Wiggins, with an air of independence.
      Wiggins was not a Mr. Gloucester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; demanded Carpentaria, mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, your note, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What note?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wiggins pulled a crumpled paper from his pocket and handed it to
      Carpentaria, who read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to me in my office at once. If I am not there, wait for me. The
      bearer will take your duties meanwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C. Carpentaria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;And who brought this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Soudanese, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which Soudanese?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. They&rsquo;re all alike to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it didn&rsquo;t occur to you that this note was forged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. Why should it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t occur to you,&rdquo; Carpentaria continued, &ldquo;that I was conducting my
      concert, and that therefore I couldn&rsquo;t possibly be in my office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know anything about any concert, sir. I&rsquo;m doorkeeper here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not know about my concert!&rdquo; cried Carpentaria. Then he calmed himself.
      &ldquo;Mr. Ilam came before the Soudanese brought the note to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, but only a few seconds before. He had but just gone in when the
      Soudanese came. I was talking to the driver of the motor-car as was
      waiting, sir, here in front of the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh. So there was a motor-car?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. It was one of the City cars. No. 28, sir. To take the money
      away, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. Who was the driver? Do you know his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think his name&rsquo;s Pratt, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you left immediately and went to my office and waited for me, and
      then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I got tired of waiting and I came back here, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;Mr. Gloucester, the garage is indicated as our
      next resort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The immense garage of the City was close to the northern entrance gates.
      And it, too, was guarded by a doorkeeper, hidden in a little box near the
      double-wooden doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know if Car No. 28 has come in,&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Came in twenty minutes ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the doorkeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was driving it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show us the car, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They passed into the desert expanse of the garage, where a few men were
      cleaning cars. Car No. 28 was in its place. In shape it was rather like a
      police-van, but smaller. Carpentaria noticed that its wheels were very
      dirty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open it,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key was found, and the interior of the car exposed to the light of a
      lantern. And at the extremity of the car could be seen a vague mass, a
      collection of limbs and clothes on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get in,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, &ldquo;and see what that is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next moment two men were dragged out of the car in a state of stupor.
      One was the Soudanese entitled &ldquo;Spats,&rdquo; who had become Ilam&rsquo;s bodyguard,
      and the other wore the uniform of an automobile driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; Carpentaria asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks precious like Pratt, the man as usually drives this car, sir,&rdquo;
       answered the doorkeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the attendants in the place had now gathered round.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII&mdash;Carpentaria as Detective
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>ou will now relate
      to me, as accurately as you can,&rdquo; said Carpentaria somewhat peremptorily
      to Pratt the chauffeur, &ldquo;exactly what were the circumstances which led to
      your ceasing to be master of your car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria had had Pratt and the Soudanese carried to the strong-room,
      the heart of the City, where a chemist and Dr. Rivers had united to treat
      them for the effects of the narcotic which had evidently, by some means,
      been administered to them. Rivers repeated that, so far as he could judge,
      the narcotic employed was chloral hydrate, a drug more powerful than
      morphine, more effective in its action on the heart, and less annoying to
      other functional parts of the body. When Rivers and the chemist had
      finished their ministrations, Carpentaria had politely intimated to them
      that he did not absolutely insist on their remaining&mdash;a piece of
      information which surprised the doctor, who, having been let into one of
      his director&rsquo;s secrets, expected, with the confidence of youth, to be let
      into all of them. The three men, two white and one Ethiop, were thus alone
      together in the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said Pratt, who was a fair man, talkative, with, just at
      present, a terrific sense of his own importance as the central hero of a
      mysterious drama. &ldquo;It was like this: After I&rsquo;d had the drink&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What drink?&rdquo; demanded Carpentaria sharply. &ldquo;The drink the other driver
      offered to me, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What other driver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There came up another driver, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the City uniform?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was he? What was his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No idea, sir. I seemed to remember his face, like, but I couldn&rsquo;t
      recollect his name. I asked him his name, and he said: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t try to be
      funny, Pratt; you&rsquo;ve had a drop too much.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And had you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, sir&mdash;of course I hadn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;d made two journeys to the Bank
      with full loads, and the next one was to be the last, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you hadn&rsquo;t had anything to drink at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to speak of, sir. A glass of port at Short&rsquo;s as I was coming back
      the first time, and a pint of beer&mdash;or it might have been a pint and
      a half&mdash;at the Redcliffe as I was coming back the second time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was absolutely all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, except a drop of whisky which was left in my flask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how came the other driver to be in a position to offer you drink? Was
      he carrying casks and other things about with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, only a flask. Every chauffeur has a flask. Necessary, sir. Cold
      work, sir. And you&rsquo;ll recollect it hasn&rsquo;t been exactly sultry to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say? Are you in the habit of accepting drinks from men whose
      names you can&rsquo;t call to mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was in the profession, sir, and in the uniform; besides, he said he&rsquo;d
      got a new cordial, fresh from Madeira, that would keep anyone warm, even
      in the depth of winter, for at least two hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this isn&rsquo;t the depth of winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; but, as the cordial was handy, I thought I might as well try
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when you had tried it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt rather jolly, sir. I never felt better in my life, and thinks I to
      myself: &lsquo;I&rsquo;d better write down the name and address of this cordial before
      I forget it.&rsquo; So I says: &lsquo;What&rsquo;s-your-name,&rsquo; I says, meaning the other
      driver, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the name and address of this cordial, before I forget it?&rsquo;
      And I was just taking a pencil out of my pocket to write it down when I
      felt a bit less jolly and the pencil wouldn&rsquo;t stop in my hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were on your driving seat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is all you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Except that once, dreamy like, I thought I was in prison for
      exceeding the legal limit, and that all the lights in the prison were
      turned out, and an earthquake was going on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other driver stood in the road by the car, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was he dressed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you, sir. This uniform. Blue and white cap, same as this, and
      long overcoat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t see what he wore underneath the overcoat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; Carpentaria turned swiftly on the Soudanese. &ldquo;Did you drink
      too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spats smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And after you had drunk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spats shook his head, still smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He means he doesn&rsquo;t remember anything,&rdquo; Pratt explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you remember nothing?&rdquo; Carpentaria questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you drink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Soudanese looked at Pratt, smiling.. &ldquo;Because Pratt drank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been waiting on Mr. Ilam lately, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he came to the outer door there, and entered in here, did he tell
      you to wait outside?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can both go,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;Come to me at eight o&rsquo;clock
      to-morrow, Pratt, in case I should want you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Pratt. &ldquo;Yes, sah,&rdquo; said the Soudanese.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not you,&rdquo; Carpentaria explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; said Carpentaria to the Ethiopian. &ldquo;Did Mr. Ilam or any
      other person give you a note to hand to the doorkeeper outside there?&rdquo; The
      Soudanese shook his fierce and yet amiable head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Pratt, addressing him in surprise, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you come up and
      give a note to Wiggins and then go away again, and return a second time?&rdquo;
       The Soudanese shook his head once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there must have been two of &rsquo;em, sir,&rdquo; said Pratt to
      Carpentaria. &ldquo;This chap&rsquo;s honest enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me have brother,&rdquo; said the Soudanese, &ldquo;same me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Soudanese shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the native village?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and fetch him,&rdquo; ordered Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the next moment he was alone in the great chamber, and he felt tempted
      simply to go to the regular police, of whom a few were constantly employed
      by the City, and tell them what had happened, and leave the whole affair
      entirely in their hands. And then the strange attraction which always
      emanates from a mystery appealed to him so strongly that he determined to
      probe a little further into the peculiar matter of Ilam&rsquo;s disappearance,
      without the aid of professional detectives. He didn&rsquo;t imagine for an
      instant that Ilam was dead. He was capable of believing that Ilam had
      disappeared willingly; and yet such a theory, having regard to the
      recitals of Mr. Gloucester and of the bank-clerk (by this time doubtless
      on his way to Weybridge, and the young thing) was to say the least
      exceedingly improbable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He unlocked the door and went outside. Wiggins was at his post, actuated
      by the exaggerated alertness which characterizes one who has been caught
      napping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything happened, Wiggins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. Nothing whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall return soon. If the Soudanese comes, keep him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He passed into the Central Way, which was almost deserted. The last
      visitor, the very last stalwart of the Y.M.C.A., had departed, and the
      sole signs of life in the great thoroughfare were a lamplighter
      extinguishing the gas-lamps which were provided in case of a sudden
      failure of electricity, and a road-sweeper in charge of a complicated
      machine with two horses. The clock in the tower of the Exposition Palace
      showed half an hour after closing time. The moon was peeping over the
      eastern roofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria went to the garage, and, not without difficulty, for it was
      shut up, made his way into the interior and procured some light. He wished
      to make a thorough examination of the car which had been employed as the
      instrument of the plot. He had it drawn out to the centre of the garage,
      under the full flare of an electric chandelier. A sleepy attendant hovered
      in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get a ladder and see if there&rsquo;s anything on the roof of the van&mdash;any
      tyres or boxes or anything,&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only this, sir,&rdquo; replied the attendant when he had climbed up,
      and he produced a cap and overcoat of the City uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; exclaimed Carpentaria, and a notion struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doorkeeper gone to bed?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wake him and tell him I want him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While waiting for the doorkeeper, Carpentaria scrutinized attentively the
      wheels of the vehicle; those wheels, even on his first visit, had put an
      idea into his head. Then the doorkeeper arrived, not quite as spruce and
      perfect as a doorkeeper ought to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one can enter this garage except under your observation?&rdquo; Carpentaria
      asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one,&rdquo; said the doorkeeper, positively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t keep such a careful eye on the people who go out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally not, sir. They can&rsquo;t go out till they&rsquo;ve been in, and if
      they&rsquo;ve been in they&rsquo;re all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. Now try to remember. Soon after this car returned to the garage
      to-night, did any one leave the garage who was unfamiliar to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember, sir. You see, sir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. I see. I am not blaming you. Your theory, though defective, is a
      natural one. Now, do you remember, for instance, a man in a blue suit,
      with grey hair, going out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my soul, I believe I do, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are certain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, sir. I&rsquo;m not certain. But I have a sort of a hazy idea&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at these wheels,&rdquo; Carpentaria cut him short. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s clayey mud,
      isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where could the car have been to get that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s that passage down under the embankment, sir, that way as leads to
      the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doorkeeper,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, &ldquo;you are brilliant. I also have thought of
      that spot, where just such clay exists. But why should the car go down
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the doorkeeper. &ldquo;There you beat me, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then perhaps you are not so brilliant after all,&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      And having minutely examined the interior of the car, with no result, he
      left the garage, and returned to the strong room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Soudanese was awaiting him at the door, and there were evident signs
      of a quarrelsome temper on the part of Wiggins. Wiggins had not forgotten
      the colour of the messenger who had handed him the forged note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Carpentaria asked of the Soudanese. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man shook his head, but not smilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one knows at the village where he&rsquo;s gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spats shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wiggins,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;Is this the man who brought you the note?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wiggins hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he said at length&rsquo;, resentfully. &ldquo;But they&rsquo;re all alike, them
      folk are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; murmured Carpentaria. &ldquo;Since there is nothing to guard here, you
      may as well go, Wiggins. You, too, Spats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two minutes later he was crossing the Oriental Gardens in the direction of
      the Thames. And when he had travelled two hundred yards or so he heard
      footsteps behind him, light, rapid, irregular. He turned quickly, his hand
      on the revolver in his pocket, to face his pursuer. His pursuer, however,
      was Pauline Dartmouth and no other. So he left the revolver where it was.

      CHAPTER XXIII&mdash;The Talk in the Garden
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>he was so out of
      breath that at first it seemed as if she could not speak. He could hear
      her hurried breathing, almost like the catch of a sob, and in the
      moonlight he could see fairly clearly her flushed face, under the hat, and
      her tall, rather imperious figure. But he could not make out the
      expression of her eyes. Nevertheless, as he peered curiously into them,
      the thought suddenly struck him: &ldquo;She is angry with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Carpentaria, I want to have a word with you,&rdquo; she said at length,
      stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Dartmouth,&rdquo; he answered in his courtly and elaborate manner,
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted. What can I do for you? I regret very much that you
      should have had to run after me like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been following you up for quite a long time,&rdquo; she remarked, in a
      more friendly tone. It appeared as if his attitude and greeting had made
      some impression on her, in spite of herself. &ldquo;First I went to your office.
      Then to the strong-rooms, then to the garage, then to the strong-rooms
      again, and now I&rsquo;m here. I saw you crossing the gardens. Nobody seemed to
      be inclined to give me any information about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo; he murmured, in a cautious interrogative. &ldquo;Now tell me; how can I be
      of service to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She scanned his features. They were alone together in the midst of the
      immense gardens. A hundred yards away was the bandstand, the scene of the
      greatest triumphs of his life. And yet in that moment his triumphs seemed
      nothing to him as he stood under her gaze. Her personality affected him
      powerfully. He said to himself that no woman had ever looked at him like
      that. There was no admiration in her glance, no prejudice either for or
      against him; nothing but a candid and judicial inquiry. &ldquo;I hope I shall
      come well out of this scrutiny,&rdquo; his thoughts ran. And the masculine
      desire formed obscurely in his breast to make this girl think favourably
      of him, to make her admire him, love him, worship him. He felt that to see
      love in these calm, courageous, independent eyes of hers would be a
      recompense and a reward for all he had suffered in the forty years of his
      existence. In a word she piqued him. He little knew that up to that very
      evening she had worshipped him afar off as women do worship their heroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody ill, I hope,&rdquo; he ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ignored the observation, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Carpentaria, what have you done with Cousin Ilam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he cried, amazed both by the question, and by the cold firmness
      with which it was put.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you heard what I said,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;What have you done with
      Cousin Ilam? Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Dartmouth, do you imagine for one instant that I know where Mr. Ilam
      is? I should only like to know where he is. I&rsquo;m looking for him now. But I
      was not aware that the fact of his disappearance was known. Indeed, I
      meant it to be kept as secret as possible. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she interrupted him. &ldquo;I was hoping you would be frank. I thought
      you had an honest face, Mr. Carpentaria, and it is because of that that I
      have come&mdash;like this. I have just left your poor sister. She is in
      despair. She has told me all.&rdquo; Carpentaria did not reply immediately. At
      last he repeated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told you all? All what? You have soon become fast friends, you and
      Juliette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is possible,&rdquo; said Pauline drily. &ldquo;I have met your sister three times,
      but in seasons of distress we women are obliged to cling to each other. As
      for Miss D&rsquo;Avray and me, we live next door to each other. What more
      natural than that I should call on her this evening? And finding her in a
      condition of&mdash;shall I say?&mdash;despair, what more natural than that
      I should ask her what was the matter, and what more natural, seeing that
      she has no women friends here, and is of a nature that demands sympathy,
      than that on the spur of the moment she should confide in me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, Miss Dartmouth,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, &ldquo;that I was entirely
      unaware of my sister&rsquo;s despair&mdash;as you call it. What precisely has
      she confided to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, about her engagement to Cousin Ilam, and your opposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, there has been no engagement,&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said Pauline, &ldquo;there has been an engagement, because my
      cousin and your half-sister made it. Is there anybody better qualified
      than them to make an engagement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;Let us assume that there was an engagement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were to be married to-morrow,&rdquo; remarked Pauline calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo; Carpentaria exclaimed, aghast. &ldquo;Secretly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you pretend to be surprised? As for the secrecy, your opposition
      has forced them to secrecy, because your sister is afraid of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now that your cousin has disappeared, of course, they can&rsquo;t be
      married to-morrow,&rdquo; mused Carpentaria. &ldquo;Hence this woe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you taken such extreme measures, such cruel measures, such
      wicked measures?&rdquo; asked Pauline, full of indignation. &ldquo;I can understand
      well enough that you, as a great artist, cannot be expected to behave like
      other people; I can understand you doing mad things, original things. I
      can understand you defying the law, and taking the most serious risks on
      yourself. But I can&rsquo;t understand you being so cruel to your sister, and so
      utterly beside yourself, as to carry off Mr. Ilam by force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her cheeks had flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By force?&rdquo; murmured Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he laughed loudly, violently, magnificently, after his manner. His
      laugh resounded through the deserted gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juliette thinks I have removed her betrothed by force?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally she does!&rdquo; said Pauline. &ldquo;The most extraordinary rumours are
      about. It is even said that you have had a quarrel and killed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut-tut!&rdquo; said Carpentaria, and after clearing his throat he proceeded:
      &ldquo;Miss Dartmouth, will you kindly fix your eyes on mine. I tell you I have
      had nothing whatever to do with your cousin&rsquo;s disappearance, and that I
      was entirely unaware of his intention to marry Juliette to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at him doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On your honour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said proudly, &ldquo;not on my honour. When I talk to a person as I am
      talking to you, if I say a thing is so, it is so. I decline to back my
      assertions with my honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; she whispered softly, and her eyes fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will you shake hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she gave him her hand loyally. And he thought it was a very slim and
      thrilling hand to shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was exceedingly naughty of you to go and
      credit me with being such a monster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;perhaps I never did really believe it.&rdquo; She smiled
      at him courageously. &ldquo;But I was angry with you for objecting to the match.
      I suppose you won&rsquo;t deny that you have objected to the match.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t deny that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your reasons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not disclose them to Mr. Ilam&rsquo;s cousin,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;And
      perhaps they are not as strong as they were. I am beginning to think that
      just as you accused me wrongly, so I have accused your cousin wrongly. But
      I can assure you I had better reason than you. Ah, Miss Dartmouth,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;it may well occur that you will infinitely regret ever having come
      into the City.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she said positively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very polite,&rdquo; he commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are getting away from the point,&rdquo; she remarked in a new tone. &ldquo;I have
      left your sister in a pitiable state. If you have not had anything to do
      with the disappearance of Cousin Ilam, who has?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may have disappeared voluntarily,&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so too.&rdquo; Carpentaria agreed. &ldquo;At first I was capable of believing
      that he had played an enormous comedy in order to disappear in the most
      effective manner. But really the comedy grows too enormous to be any
      longer a comedy. It may be a tragedy by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whom do you suspect?&rdquo; queried Pauline impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were you,&rdquo; was Carpentaria&rsquo;s strange response, &ldquo;I should ask your
      sister, Miss Rosie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Carpentaria, what on earth do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that your sister probably knows something of the affair. Where is
      she at the present moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is watching Mrs. Ilam, in place of the nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gravely doubt it,&rdquo; said Carpentaria with firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have seen her there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is conceivable,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;But I gravely doubt if she is
      still there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be compelled to think that after all you are a little mad,&rdquo;
       Pauline observed coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are all more or less mad,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;Otherwise your sister,
      for instance, would not hold long conversations with a highly suspicious
      character every night from the window of her room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline, in the light of her knowledge of what had taken place in and
      about the Ilam bungalow on the first night of her residence there, could
      scarcely affect not to understand, at any rate partially, Carpentaria&rsquo;s
      allusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began, lamely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; he interrupted her at once, &ldquo;do you mean to say,
      dear lady, that you are entirely unaware of the surreptitious visits of a
      certain mysterious person to Mr. Ilam&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not entirely unaware of them,&rdquo; she said frankly! &ldquo;I saw the man
      myself one night. I spoke to him. My sister also&mdash;also spoke to him.
      But I have not seen nor heard of him since. Nor has Rosie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of that you are sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I may say I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I must undeceive you,&rdquo; Carpentaria spoke firmly. &ldquo;I also have
      acquired a certain curiosity as to that strange individual. And to satisfy
      my curiosity I have kept a considerable number of vigils. And I am in a
      position to state that, not only on the first night of your arrival, but
      every night your sister has had speech with that person from the window of
      her room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he? What can he want?&rdquo; demanded Pauline, nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a question that I meant to put to you,&rdquo; said Carpentaria in
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for me, I know nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you spoke to him, as you admit you did, did he not ask you to do
      something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I refused his request.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your sister? What did she do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Mr. Carpentaria,&rdquo; murmured Pauline, &ldquo;can I trust you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She related to him all the details of the episode of the black box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And after that,&rdquo; Carpentaria commented, &ldquo;your sister continues to have
      stolen interviews with this man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help thinking you are mistaken. Rosie would never keep such a
      secret from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be very easy to throw some light on the matter,&rdquo; said
      Carpentaria. &ldquo;Let us go to your house and see whether Miss Rosie is in
      Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s room as you imagine her to be, and as I imagine her not to be.
      I may tell you quite openly my opinion that Miss Rosie has had something
      to do with the disappearance of Mr. Ilam. I am convinced, indeed I know,
      that he has been spirited away, together with a trifling amount of money,
      by our mysterious visitor, and since our mysterious visitor talks to Miss
      Rosie each night, she on her balcony and he beneath it&mdash;well, I leave
      the inference to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline started back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, in a low voice, &ldquo;let us go and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they went, walking side by side in silence across the gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will wait here,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, when they arrived at the side-door
      of the Ilam bungalow. &ldquo;You can ascertain whether anything unusual has
      occurred in the house, and particularly if your sister is still at her
      post, and then you will be kind enough to come back and report to me. I
      will watch here.&rdquo; Without replying Pauline passed into the house. In a few
      minutes she returned. Tears stood in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; queried Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosie is not in the house,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Mrs. Ilam is alone. Happily
      she is asleep. Everything is quiet. But Rosie&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sob escaped her.

      CHAPTER XXIV&mdash;The Boat
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>arpentaria and
      Pauline continued to stand motionless outside the house, both of them
      hesitant, recoiling before the circumstances which faced them. The night
      remained clear, almost brilliant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The entire situation is changed,&rdquo; said Carpentaria at length. &ldquo;A new
      factor has entered into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What factor?&rdquo; Pauline demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, your sister, of course!&rdquo; he replied, with a slight smile that
      disclosed momentarily the quizzical male person in him. &ldquo;Consider how it
      complicates the affair. If I had to deal only with the mysterious
      individual with grey hair and a blue suit&mdash;perhaps you do not know
      that he calls himself Jetsam?&mdash;I could go to work in a simple
      masculine fashion, and in the end one of us would suffer, probably he. But
      with a woman in the case&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you be sure,&rdquo; Pauline interrupted him, &ldquo;that Rosie is in the
      case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you doubt it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot understand why she should behave so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps she knew him before,&rdquo; Carpentaria hazarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Pauline positively&mdash;&ldquo;never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he has certainly been able to exercise a most remarkable influence
      over her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a hypnotic influence, or anything of that kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps an influence of quite another kind&mdash;quite another kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Rosie is scarcely half his age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do these things depend on age?&rdquo; cried Carpentaria. &ldquo;They depend on
      glances, sympathies, and trifles even more subtle than sympathies.
      Besides, she is more than half his age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; murmured Pauline, with a sudden wistful appeal in her voice, &ldquo;I
      shall trust you to help me, Mr. Carpentaria. Rosie may be in danger; she
      may be doing something very foolish, mixing herself up like this in the
      kidnapping of poor Cousin Ilam. What is to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is decidedly doing something very foolish,&rdquo; said Carpentaria,
      &ldquo;foolish, that is, from a mere ordinary common-sense point of view. But I
      don&rsquo;t think she is in any danger. I don&rsquo;t think that either she or you are
      the sort of woman that gets into danger without very good cause. As to
      what is to be done, I have an idea. Mrs. Ilam will be all right alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; for a few hours, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then will you come with me to the river? I have some investigations to
      make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as they crossed the Oriental Gardens for the second time that night,
      he told her what he knew about the use, or rather the abuse, of the
      automobile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marble parapet of the immense terrace of the gardens stood a dozen
      feet above the level of high tide. The terrace was continuous from end to
      end, but in several places it formed a viaduct over paths that ran from
      the gardens at a steep slope down to the bed of the river. It was one of
      these paths, a specially clayey one, at the point where it ran under the
      terrace, that Carpentaria suspected the automobile of having taken.
      Assuming his suspicion to be correct, the automobile could only have
      descended to the Thames, and then, if the tide gave room, turned round and
      returned; or, if the tide did not give room, backed out without turning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Its sole purpose,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, as they talked the matter over,
      &ldquo;could have been to pass something to a boat. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Pauline agreed, and then she added, &ldquo;unless they merely wanted to
      throw something into the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; He cried; &ldquo;a corpse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;I was thinking of the two thousand five hundred
      pounds in gold that you told me had been stolen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is really very clever of you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But why should they throw
      it into the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s high tide, or rather it was, about an hour and a
      half ago. They might have sunk the money, intending to recover it at their
      leisure during the night when the tide sank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I must repeat,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;this is really very clever of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were already beginning to descend the broadest of the three paths
      which led from the level of the gardens to the level of the river, and the
      wheelmarks of an automobile were clearly visible thereon, when Carpentaria
      halted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;they are there now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Mr. Jetsam and my sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not your sister. Mr. Jetsam and his&mdash;other accomplices&mdash;whoever
      they may be. I do not imagine that your sister has been concerned in the
      actual&mdash;er&mdash;affair. Indeed, she was at home with you at the
      time. But if Jetsam, for instance, should be down there now, alone or with
      others, there might be a row on my appearance. I will therefore ask you to
      stay where you are, Miss Dartmouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have begun,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I will go through with it. Besides, what
      danger could there be? People don&rsquo;t go shooting and killing promiscuously
      like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t they!&rdquo; Carpentaria exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moreover, I have no fancy to be left alone here now,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;And
      most likely there isn&rsquo;t anyone there at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you hear the splash of an oar? Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;And is not that the noise of a boat crunching on the
      beach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The path disappeared mysteriously before them under the terrace; they
      could not see the end of it. But the sound-waves came clearly enough
      through the little tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go back,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, &ldquo;and slip on to the terrace. Behind
      the parapet we can see anything that may happen to be going on. But
      quietly, quietly, dear lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments they were creeping across the broad terrace.
      Simultaneously they bent down, side by side, under the parapet and looked
      between its squat, rounded pillars at the water below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline gave a slight smothered cry, which Carpentaria, with an imperious
      gesture, bade her check.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; he whispered in her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosie&mdash;Rosie and no other&mdash;was manoeuvring a boat off the shore.
      Her face, her dress, her hat, were plainly visible in the moonlight. She
      stood up in the boat, and by means of a boat-hook hooked to a large oblong
      stone, drew the boat to the shore. She then seized the painter and jumped
      lightly out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curious thing was that she went directly to the large oblong stone,
      and with a great effort, lifted it up in her arms, tottered with it to the
      boat, and deposited it therein. Carpentaria perceived then that the stone
      was not a stone, but one of the coffers in which was kept the gold of the
      City of Pleasure. He perceived also that, attached to the coffer, was a
      dozen feet or so of rope with a cork float at the end. Rosie followed the
      coffer into the boat, pushed off, and then, at a distance of a few yards
      from the shore, pitched the coffer into the river. This done, she landed,
      made fast the painter of the boat to an iron ring in the wall of the
      embankment and departed; and she did it all rather neatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately she had disappeared under the terrace, Pauline cried, starting
      up:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go to her&mdash;I must ask her what she means by doing such
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said Carpentaria; &ldquo;you must do nothing of the kind. I most
      seriously beg you to do nothing of the kind. By interfering now you may
      spoil the coup which we may ultimately make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite comprehend you,&rdquo; Pauline observed. &ldquo;Miss Dartmouth,&rdquo; he
      addressed her excitedly, &ldquo;there can be no doubt in your mind now that your
      sister is concerned in this plot, whatever it is. I am perfectly convinced
      that her motives are good, honourable, kind-hearted. But she is concerned
      in it. We must, therefore, so far as we can, treat her as one of the
      conspirators&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always with profound respect,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;Had the person in the
      boat been any other than your sister, should we have revealed ourselves?
      Certainly not! We should have followed the plot to its next development,
      with this advantage&mdash;that we knew something which the conspirators
      imagined to be a secret. The fact that the person in the boat was your
      sister must not alter our course of conduct. And permit me to add, Miss
      Dartmouth, that you first approached me on behalf of <i>my</i> sister. We
      owe something to her, do we not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Pauline in a low voice. &ldquo;Then what do you mean to do next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suggest that we go back to your house, to see whether your sister has
      returned. May I ask whether, when you last spoke to her, she gave you to
      understand that she meant to stay with Mrs. Ilam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline breathed a reluctant affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No hint that she was going out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None. And&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; Pauline sighed. &ldquo;Must I tell you? Yes, I must! I&rsquo;m sure Rosie
      is acting for the best, but really it was not her turn to watch Mrs. Ilam
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose turn was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nurse&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your sister changed the rotation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She said the nurse needed a holiday, and told her she could go away
      for twenty-four hours, and that she would take her place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About six o&rsquo;clock this evening, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where has the nurse gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nurse has gone to a concert at Queen&rsquo;s Hall, and will sleep at the
      house of some friends at Islington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does your sister imagine you to be in bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect so,&rdquo; said Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      They slowly returned to the neighbourhood of the bungalows. Carpentaria
      wanted to hurry, but it seemed as though Pauline was being held back by
      some occult force. As a matter of fact, she dreaded the moment when she
      should re-enter the house. But at length, they stood once again by the
      doorstep of Josephus Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo; Pauline demanded sadly. &ldquo;What do you think will be the
      best thing to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have not seen your sister in the gardens,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;She has
      most probably returned. She would not be likely to leave Mrs. Ilam for
      very long, would she? Go and see if she has returned, if she is in Mrs.
      Ham&rsquo;s room. And if she is, question her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how? What am I to say? Am I to ask her if she has been out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means!&rdquo; said Carpentaria promptly. &ldquo;You are to pretend that you
      know nothing. You must approach her diplomatically. Either she will tell
      the truth or she will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lie! Lie!&rdquo; cried Pauline. &ldquo;Say it openly! Say the word! Admit that you
      are persuading me to behave despicably to the creature who is dearest to
      me in all the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is duplicity,&rdquo; Carpentaria answered, &ldquo;you, at any rate, did not
      begin it. We are convinced of your sister&rsquo;s good intentions. What else
      matters? In a few days, perhaps to-morrow, all will be explained. Let me
      entreat you to go at once. I will await your report.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head sadly, opened the door with her latchkey, and was just
      about to shut it when Carpentaria stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have told me your sister believes you to be in
      bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say &lsquo;probably.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is important that she should not be undeceived. I need not insist. You
      can easily make it appear that, having been awakened by some noise, you
      have got up. Eh?&rdquo; And he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to smile in return, and disappeared from his view. Within the
      house, she crept upstairs, and into her bedroom, feeling like a thief.
      When she emerged therefrom she had put on a <i>peignoir</i>, and her <i>coiffure</i>
      was disarranged. She went to the door of Mrs. Ham&rsquo;s room, and listened
      intently. There was not a sound. If she was to obey Carpentaria she must
      enter, and she must wear a false mask: to that sister to whom she had all
      her life been as sincere as it is possible for one human being to be to
      another. Well, she could not enter&mdash;she could not enter! Her legs
      would not carry her through the doorway. And so, instead of going in, she
      called:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But her voice was so weak that she scarcely even heard it herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      No reply came from the interior. And she called again, this time quite
      loudly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosie, dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she opened the door an inch or two. There was a rush of skirts across
      the room, and Rosie appeared. She was evidently in a state of extreme
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Are you ill?&rdquo; asked Rosie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I was wakened by some noise or other,&rdquo; said Pauline painfully,
      and it appeared to her that Carpentaria was whispering in her ear the
      words that she must say. &ldquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;I&mdash;I thought perhaps
      something had gone wrong here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was Rosie&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;But how queer you look, darling! You must have
      had a nightmare. You have quite startled me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline did not answer at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t undressed! You haven&rsquo;t lain down,&rdquo; she said at length. &ldquo;I
      thought you could always sleep very well on that sofa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I can,&rdquo; said Rosie. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve been reading. And besides&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      rather upsetting about Cousin Ilam. I wonder where he can be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Pauline remarked summarily, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s pretty certain to turn up
      to-morrow. I expect he&rsquo;s gone into town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosie yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-night, darling,&rdquo; said Pauline, and took Rosie&rsquo;s hand. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How cold your hand is!&rdquo; Pauline observed, with an inward tremor. &ldquo;Have
      you been out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been out? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Outside on to the balcony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I haven&rsquo;t stirred from my chair, darling. Bye-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stared at each other for an instant, each full of dissimulation, and
      yet also of love, and then they kissed one another passionately, and
      Pauline departed. They were women.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV&mdash;-A Wholesale Departure
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>aving retired to
      her bedroom and divested herself of the deceitful <i>peignoir</i>, Pauline
      made her way, with all the precautions of secrecy, downstairs again, and
      so to the door which gave on the avenue. Carpentaria was not in view when
      she timorously put her head out of the door, and she was in a mind to rush
      back to her sister in order to confide in her absolutely, and to demand in
      return her entire confidence. She allowed herself to suspect for a brief
      instant that, after all, Carpentaria had not been behaving openly with
      her; but just then the musician arrived&mdash;he had evidently been
      watching the other side of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were right,&rdquo; she whispered, before he had time to ask a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister denies that she has been out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does this help us?&rdquo; she inquired, as it were, bitterly. &ldquo;Are we any
      better off, now that I have lied to Rosie, and forced Rosie to lie to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Pauline retorted. &ldquo;And I have passed the most dreadful five
      minutes of all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to be desolated, to be filled with grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, so very sorry,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;You have been quite right. We find ourselves
      in the centre of a mystery, and I have no excuse for being sentimental. My
      trust in Rosie remains what it always was. Still, facts are facts, and I
      am ready to do whatever you instruct me to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your sister must have had some reason for insisting on
      watching Mrs. Ilam out of her turn; and that reason is not connected with
      the little matter of the boat. If she had merely wished to go unobserved
      to the boat she would have gone to bed as usual and said nothing, wouldn&rsquo;t
      she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is obvious, therefore, that there is something else to be done, or to
      occur&mdash;probably in Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s bedroom. For if it is not to happen in
      Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s bedroom, why should your sister have voluntarily tied herself
      up there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what could possibly happen in Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s bedroom?&rdquo; demanded Pauline,
      with a nervous start of apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; Carpentaria replied. &ldquo;I can only point to certain
      indications, which lead to certain conclusions. You will oblige me by
      watching, Miss Dartmouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The landing and the stairs of your house. Is there a view of the stairs
      from your room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you can watch from there. Do not burn a light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if anything strange does occur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to your balcony, and tie a white handkerchief to the railings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; queried Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment there was the sound of a window opening in Carpentaria&rsquo;s
      bungalow across the avenue, and a voice called plaintively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carlos, is that you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; he answered, as low as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to her. Comfort her,&rdquo; Pauline enjoined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming to you,&rdquo; he obediently called in the direction of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of them could see the vague figure of Juliette, framed in the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing!&rdquo; murmured Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afterwards,&rdquo; said Carpentaria hurriedly, &ldquo;I shall come out again and
      watch the outside of your house. With you inside and me outside, it will
      be very difficult for anything peculiar to occur without our knowledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he left her, impressed by her common sense and her self-control, and
      withal her utter womanliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hall of his own house was dark, and all the rooms of the ground-floor
      deserted. He mounted to the upper story. Juliette, hearing his footsteps,
      had come to the door of the study, from whose window she had hailed him,
      and she stared at him with a fixed and almost stony gaze as he approached.
      Her figure was silhouetted against the electric light in the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn that light out instantly,&rdquo; he said, with involuntary sternness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not move, and, obsessed by the importance of giving to anyone who
      might be spying the impression that all the occupants of the house had
      retired for the night, he pushed past her and turned off the switch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Carlos,&rdquo; Juliette sighed, &ldquo;how cruel you are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He now saw her indistinctly in the deep gloom of the chamber, and her form
      seemed pathetic to him, and her sad, despairing voice even more pathetic.
      He went up to her impulsively and took her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juliette,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;can you believe it of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Dartmouth has spoken to you?&rdquo; she asked, a glimmer of hope in her
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Can you believe that I have&mdash;have caused anything to
      be done to Ilam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you not?&rdquo; she demanded eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he told her what he had previously told Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thanked him with an affectionate kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carlos,&rdquo; she said, and the words fell in a little torrent from her mouth,
      &ldquo;I told you a falsehood this morning. I acted a part. He was in my
      sitting-room all the time. Can you forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sure of it,&rdquo; said Carpentaria calmly, &ldquo;and I can forgive you,&rdquo; he
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know what it is to love,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You have never cared for
      anyone&mdash;in that way. I hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;until I met&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who says I don&rsquo;t know what it is to love!&rdquo; he stopped her. &ldquo;Perhaps I am
      learning. But tell me, when did you last see Ilam? Have you seen him since
      this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At his offices this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gave no hint that he was in any danger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No immediate danger. Oh, Carlos, he is not what you think him to be. He
      is an honest man, and I am so sorry for him, and I love him. Where is he?
      What has happened to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you now,&rdquo; was Carpentaria&rsquo;s reply, &ldquo;but before morning we
      shall know more, or I am mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for the crimes of others that he is suffering,&rdquo; said Juliette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told you so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I guess; I am sure. I know all his faults&mdash;all of them. I do
      not hide one of them from myself. Why should I, since he loves me and I
      love him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child,&rdquo; said Carpentaria abruptly, &ldquo;you might have trusted me more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have trusted you absolutely,&rdquo; answered Juliette, &ldquo;but he is
      afraid of you. He would not let me. I could not disobey him. Sometime,
      somehow, you must have said something to frighten him and, though he is so
      big and strong, he is timid; he has timid eyes. It was because of his eyes
      that I first began to like him. Carlos, what are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to watch,&rdquo; was the response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man came to the back-door not long since, and asked whether you were at
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man came to the back-door?&rdquo; repeated Carpentaria sharply, every nerve
      suddenly on the strain. &ldquo;Who was it? What did you say to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At first I thought it was one of the night-staff, and then the man&rsquo;s face
      made me suspicious; I imagined it might be a thief&mdash;you know what a
      state I am in, Carlos&mdash;and so I told him you had just gone to bed,
      and I shut the door in his face. I didn&rsquo;t want him to think there were
      only women in the house. But, of course, it couldn&rsquo;t have been a burglar&mdash;here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the wisest thing you have done this day, Juliette,&rdquo; Carpentaria
      remarked; and then he questioned her as to the appearance of the
      mysterious inquirer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to leave me?&rdquo; cried Juliette, when Carpentaria picked up
      his hat, which had fallen from a chair to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you must try to rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then they were both startled by a strange noise on the window-pane.
      They listened. The noise was repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it rain?&rdquo; asked Juliette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s gravel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went out on to the balcony. A form was discernible in the avenue below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Miss Dartmouth?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came the reply. &ldquo;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he warned her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you in a second.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a brief explanation to Juliette, he hastened downstairs and let
      himself out of the house. Pauline was already standing at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything happened?&rdquo; he questioned her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing has happened,&rdquo; said Pauline, &ldquo;but there is something extremely
      curious, all the same, in our house. It is a most singular thing that the
      housemaid, who never forgets anything, forgot just to-night to leave some
      milk in my room&mdash;a thing which I had specially reminded her to
      remember, so I rang the bell for her. There is a bell that communicates
      direct with her room&mdash;it used to be in Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s bedroom, but we
      have had it changed&mdash;there was no answer. I rang again. No answer.
      You know, I&rsquo;m the sort of person that can&rsquo;t stand that sort of thing from
      servants, so I went upstairs to her. She was not in her room. There are
      two beds in that room, the second one for the cook. Both beds were empty;
      they had neither of them been slept in. I went into the rooms of the other
      servants. They are all empty. Rosie and I and Mrs. Ilam are alone in the
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you tell your sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I came straight here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was very discreet of you,&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am beginning to get frightened,&rdquo; Pauline added. &ldquo;What can it mean? All
      the servants gone&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI&mdash;The Empty Bedroom
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ithin the bungalow
      of the Ilams there remained only two persons who were legally entitled to
      be there, and those persons were Mrs. Ilam, motionless for ever, but with
      her bright, tragic eyes staring continually at the same point in the
      ceiling, and Rosie Dartmouth. These two women, however, were decidedly not
      alone in the house. It was a large house, a bungalow more by the character
      of its architecture and its many balconies, than by its size and shape.
      Most bungalows are long and low; this one was long without being low. On
      the ground floor were the reception rooms and kitchen offices; on the
      first floor were the principal bedrooms; and above these was a low-ceiled
      floor of servants&rsquo; bedrooms. Nor was that all; for the steeply-sloping
      roof had been utilized by an architect who hated to waste space as a miser
      hates to waste money, and hence, above even the servants&rsquo; floor was a vast
      attic, serviceable for storage. The attic was reached by a little flight
      of stairs of its own, and it was lighted by two panes of glass let into
      the roof, one on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ground-floor and the servants&rsquo; floor were now dark and uninhabited. On
      the first floor the only occupied room was the bedchamber of Mrs. Ilam,
      where Rosie stood nervously by the mantelpiece in an attitude of uneasy
      expectation. The sole illumination was given by the small rose-shaded
      lamp, which threw a circle of light on the white cloth of the invalid&rsquo;s
      night-table; all else, including Rosie, was in gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosie was evidently listening&mdash;the door was ajar&mdash;and after a
      few moments she stepped hastily outside on to the landing, and glanced up
      the well of the staircase. At the summit of the staircase she saw the door
      of the great attic open, and a figure emerge; the figure, which was
      carrying a small electric lantern, carefully locked the door of the attic
      behind it, and then, with some deliberation, descended the narrow attic
      stairs, and, more quietly, the stairs from the servants&rsquo; floor to the
      first floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure was that of Mr. Jetsam, clothed in his eternal suit of blue
      serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stairs and landing were quite dark, save for his lantern and the faint
      glimmer that came from Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s bedroom. Mr. Jetsam had moved without a
      sound, for he was wearing thick felt slippers. He did not immediately
      notice Rosie on the landing, and when the light of his lantern caught and
      showed her dress, he started back slightly. Rosie made no move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not expect you to be there,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She regarded him with steady eyes, and then, without a word, motioned him
      to proceed further downstairs to the ground-floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to talk to me?&rdquo; he whispered again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a voice which was curiously capable of being almost inaudible, and
      yet at the same time distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to the open door of Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s room, but Rosie shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head once more, and they went downstairs to the dining-room,
      both silently creeping. With infinite precautions he opened the
      dining-room door, and shut it when they had entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been better to remain upstairs,&rdquo; he said mildly. &ldquo;The least
      possible movement is dangerous enough. At this stage a creaking stair
      might spoil the whole business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot talk there,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, since Mrs. Ilam is utterly helpless,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;what can it
      matter what she hears? She cannot talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact that she hears is more than enough to upset me,&rdquo; said Rosie. &ldquo;I
      am like that, you see. I know it is silly, but I can&rsquo;t help it. I wanted
      to tell you that I have just had a dreadful scene with Pauline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dreadful scene! You&rsquo;ve not quarrelled?&rdquo; he demanded anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! But I&rsquo;ve lied to her&mdash;I&rsquo;ve lied to her in the most shocking
      way, and, what is worse, I fancy she didn&rsquo;t quite believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She suspects something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tone sounded apprehensive in the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I hope not. In any case, what can she suspect? She&rsquo;s been
      in bed all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Mr. Jetsam reflectively. &ldquo;True! You have behaved
      magnificently, Miss Rosie. Never, never, in this world, shall I be able to
      thank you. I had not thought that such a woman as you existed. You have
      given me the first sympathy I have ever had. Yes, the first!&mdash;without
      you I could never have succeeded. I could scarcely have begun. And now I
      shall succeed. Listen to me&mdash;I shall succeed! A wrong will be
      righted. Justice will be done. If it isn&rsquo;t, I shall kill myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He finished grimly, as it were, ferociously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; pleaded Rosie.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. Then he lifted the little lantern and threw its ray on her
      face. She did not flinch. &ldquo;You are very pale,&rdquo; he remarked softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you expect?&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You have gone much further&mdash;very
      much further than I ever dreamt of. You have led me on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is your own kindness of heart, your sympathy with the
      unfortunate that has led you on. I assure you I was never so bold before I
      met you, before I appealed to you that night when you stood on your
      balcony. Do you regret? If you tell me to stop, to abandon my plans and
      depart&mdash;well, I will depart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not want you to do that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Nevertheless, I tremble for
      what you have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not tremble,&rdquo; he said coaxingly. &ldquo;If I am not safe here, where am I
      safe? Is not this the very last place where anyone would expect to find me
      and my&mdash;my booty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, then, sending the servants away,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing simpler,&rdquo; he commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I did it,&rdquo; she mused, as if aghast at the memory of what
      she had achieved; &ldquo;and as for to-morrow, how I shall explain it to Pauline
      I really can&rsquo;t imagine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;everything will be over one way or the other; you
      will be able to resume your habit of speaking the truth. By the way,&rdquo; he
      went on, in a tone carefully careless, &ldquo;you managed to do what I asked you
      with the boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you meet anyone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you pulled the plug out and cut the boat: adrift?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pulled the plug out and cut the boat adrift!&rdquo; she repeated after him,
      amazed. &ldquo;No; you never told me to do that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that was the most important thing of all. It is
      essential that there should be no trace of the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry. I never heard&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret I didn&rsquo;t make myself more clear,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;You see, at
      intervals during the night the watchmen do their patrols, and I know there
      is a regular inspection of the terrace. Supposing the boat is seen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t remember, that you asked me to do that,&rdquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; he said politely, &ldquo;what you have done deserves all my praise and
      gratitude. But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would like me to go and sink the boat, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hesitate to ask you. It is really too much&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she said passionately. &ldquo;I will go and do it&mdash;alone.&rdquo; Then
      she paused. &ldquo;But suppose I meet the patrol?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are you,&rdquo; was Jetsam&rsquo;s response. &ldquo;You are the President&rsquo;s cousin. You
      have the right to amuse yourself with a boat, at no matter what hour of
      the day or night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I will go now. I shall be back quite soon. Shall
      you be ready by the time I return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is all right?&rdquo; She seemed to question him anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite all right,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;Let me thank you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an impulsive movement he took her hand and kissed it. She blushed and
      trembled. Then he opened the door and they passed out into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will unfasten the front-door for you,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I think I can do
      it more quietly than you. It may be left on the latch till you come back;&rdquo;
       and he unfastened the front-door. Through its panes a faint light entered
      the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must get my hat,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;You can manage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. He put the light on a bracket on the landing and ascended to
      the upper parts of the house. Rosie went into her bedroom. When she came
      out, wearing a hat, she noticed for the first time that the door of
      Pauline&rsquo;s bedroom was not shut. She pushed it open very carefully, and
      peered in. A feeble reflection of the moonlight redeemed it from absolute
      obscurity, and Rosie perceived that the bed was unoccupied, that it had
      not even been slept in. Instantly her mind became full of suspicions. Had
      Pauline lied to her as she had lied to Pauline? Was her part in the plot
      of Mr. Jetsam discovered? No, impossible! And yet&mdash;Then she
      recollected having heard, or having thought that she had heard, the
      distant ringing of one of the service-bells in the house some time before
      Mr. Jetsam came downstairs. She had forgotten to mention this disturbing
      fact to Mr. Jetsam. Evidently he had not heard the ringing, or he would
      have questioned her about it. Supposing they were being watched, after
      all? And in any case where was Pauline? Pauline had given her to
      understand that she had retired to rest, and lo! the bed had not been
      touched! Full of tremors, she silently shut the door on the empty room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remembered Jetsam&rsquo;s threat of what he should do if his plans failed,
      and she hesitated.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII&mdash;The Photograph
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Jetsam, having
      with an attentive ear heard the vague sound of the shutting of a door,
      came out a second time from the mysterious attic and descended the stairs.
      He was a man to omit no precautions, and every door that he passed he
      locked on the outside, not only on the servants&rsquo; floor, but on the first
      floor. He penetrated then to the ground-floor, and fastened not merely
      every door, but every window. At last he arrived at the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity to lock her out,&rdquo; he murmured to himself; &ldquo;but what can I do?
      It would be madness to let her assist at the scene I have to go through.
      She expects to, but I must disappoint her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he noiselessly bolted and locked the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was that Mr. Jetsam&rsquo;s plans had been slightly deranged. He had
      hoped to get through his great scene&mdash;the scene to which all his
      efforts had tended&mdash;during Rosie&rsquo;s first absence on the river. He
      relied on Rosie; he had been amazed at her goodness and her fortitude; he
      had been still more amazed at his singular influence over her; and he
      naturally told her a great deal. But he did not tell her quite everything.
      He feared to frighten her. Hence proceeded one of his reasons for sending
      her to the boat, with the object of sinking the coffer further in the
      river as the tide fell. But she had dispatched the business with such
      extraordinary celerity, and he, on his part, had been so hindered by such
      an unexpected contretemps, that she was back again before even he had
      begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, he had been obliged to invent a new errand for her, and he flattered
      himself that he had invented the errand, and dispatched her on it, with a
      certain histrionic skill&mdash;and he had the right so to flatter himself.
      It desolated him to deceive her, to hoodwink her; but he saw no
      alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having secured the house, he ascended again, this time taking less care to
      maintain an absolute silence, to the first floor. The affair was fully
      launched now, and no one could interrupt him. If Pauline awoke in her
      locked bedroom and heard things, so much the worse for her, he reflected.
      She could not go out on to her balcony because he had seen long ago to the
      fastening of the window. Therefore she might cry as much as she liked. He
      laughed as he thought of this, not having the least idea that he had so
      elaborately fastened the door and the window of an empty room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s bedroom with a slight swagger, and shut the door.
      A fire was burning in the grate. He cast a single glance at the bed and
      its mute and helpless occupant, and putting his little lantern on the
      mantelpiece, he walked round the room, inspecting its arrangement and its
      corners. Then, suddenly remembering his own burglarious exploit of forcing
      an entrance into the room by the window, he approached the window, flung
      it wide open and stepped outside on to the balcony. Far across the expanse
      of the Oriental Gardens, in the moonlight, he discerned a figure vaguely
      moving in the direction of the river. It was a woman&rsquo;s figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There she is,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Admirable creature! Why did I not meet such
      a woman when I was younger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he came in again, shut and fastened the window, and drew the heavy
      curtains across it, taking care that no chink was left through which light
      could be seen. Then he began to whistle softly, and he turned on all the
      electricity in the apartment; there were a cluster of lamps in the
      ceiling, and two lights over&rsquo; the dressing-table, besides the table-lamps,
      and his own trifling gleam of a lantern. The room was brilliantly, almost
      blindingly, lit, and every object stood revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped towards the bed, and deliberately gazed into the eyes of the
      stricken old woman. Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s burning orbs blinked at intervals.
      Otherwise she gave no sign of volition or of life. Jetsam placed his eyes
      in the fixed line of her gaze, so that they were obliged to exchange a
      glance. She appeared to be unconscious of it. Only a scarcely perceptible
      trémulation ran along her arms, which lay stretched, as usual, outside the
      coverlet, like the arms of a corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jetsam, &ldquo;here I am at last, you see. Do you recognize me?
      I&rsquo;ve changed, haven&rsquo;t I, old hag? But you can&rsquo;t be mistaken in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pent-up bitterness of a lifetime escaped from him in the tones of his
      voice. But the old woman showed no symptom that the terrible past was thus
      revisiting her in its most awful form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought I was dead, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Jetsam continued. &ldquo;For over forty
      years you have been sure that I was dead, and that your crime was one of
      the thousands of crimes which go unpunished. And look here,&rdquo; he went on;
      &ldquo;if you have any doubt, murderess, as to my identity, look at this. I&rsquo;ll
      make you look at it, by heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent down, drew up the trouser of his left leg to the knee, and pushed
      the sock into his boot, so that the calf of the leg was exposed. On the
      fleshy part of the calf could be plainly seen a large birth-stain. With
      the movement of an acrobat he raised that leg over the bed, over the eyes
      of Mrs. Ilam, and held it there during several seconds. Then he dropped
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s to show you who it is you have to deal
      with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice was cruel, icy, and inexorable. He had no pity, no trace of
      mercy, for the woman who, whatever the enormity of her sins, was entitled
      to some respect by reason of her extreme age, her absolutely defenceless
      condition, and her suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me you can answer &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;by your eyelids.
      Blinking means &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; and no movement means &lsquo;no.&rsquo; I am going to put some
      questions to you. Did you take the photograph out of the box? Answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ilam closed her eyes and kept them closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; Jetsam grumbled. &ldquo;Open your eyes again, murderess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Ilam did not open her eyes again. She obstinately kept them
      closed; and she might have been asleep, except that now and then a tear
      exuded from under the lids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you open them,&rdquo; cried Jetsam.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand approached the old woman&rsquo;s eyes, but even his implacable and
      cruel bitterness recoiled from the coward villainy of touching that
      stricken and helpless organism. He drew back his hand, and some glimmering
      sense of the dreadfulness of the scene which he was acting reached his
      heart. The thought ran through his brain that it was a good thing Rosie
      had not been present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as you like. Only I know that you, or one of you,
      must have taken that photograph out of the box, and I have every reason to
      believe that it is in this room. In any case I mean to know very shortly
      whether it is or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he went abruptly out of the room, shutting the door, and
      climbed once more to the attic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jakel&rdquo; he called quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a Soudanese, the brother of Ilam&rsquo;s protector, &ldquo;Spats,&rdquo; obediently
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; said Jetsam. &ldquo;Come, pass in front of me. I will lock the
      door myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went together to Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know how to search, Jake?&rdquo; Jetsam instructed him. &ldquo;Everything in this
      room has to be searched to find a photograph&mdash;a photograph, you know&mdash;the
      same sort of thing as this.&rdquo; And he pointed to a portrait of Josephus Ilam
      that stood on the mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Soudanese nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begin with the chest of drawers,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a quarter of an hour the room was in such a state of havoc as might
      have resulted from the passage through it of a cyclone. Every drawer in
      every piece of furniture had been ransacked and emptied. The Soudanese had
      even climbed on a chair in order to inspect the top of the wardrobe, and
      had dislodged therefrom a pile of cardboard boxes. Every book had been
      torn to pieces. Piles of letters lay scattered about. The floor was heaped
      up with Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s private possessions. Chairs were overturned. One or
      two vases with narrow necks and wide bases had been smashed in order the
      better to search their interiors. The place was wrecked. But the
      mysterious photograph which Jetsam wanted had not been discovered. The
      Soudanese had found dozens of photographs, but not the right one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bed of the invalid was alone undisturbed. Among all the ruins of the
      chamber it remained untouched, white, apparently inviolate, and the old
      woman&rsquo;s arms lay ever in the same position, and her eyes, open and blazing
      now, gazed ever at the same spot in the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; exclaimed Jetsam suddenly. &ldquo;The bed&mdash;the bed! The box
      was hidden under the bed, but I got it. The photograph is hidden under the
      bed, and I will get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated. Dare he search the bed? Dare he disturb its helpless burden?
      He wondered. He was ready for anything. He was capable of slaughter, but
      he wavered and retreated before the idea of searching for the photograph
      in the place where the box had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he suddenly decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take firm hold of the bed itself, not the mattress,&rdquo; he ordered the
      Soudanese, &ldquo;and I will take hold on this side. Be very gentle. Do not
      disarrange the clothes. We will lift it over the foot of the bedstead and
      place it on the floor. Carefully now&mdash;carefully!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with the utmost delicacy the two men lifted the bed bodily and laid it
      very gently on the floor, and Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s gaze was directed to a new
      point: of the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be a change for you,&rdquo; said Jetsam, with a touch of compunction
      in his voice. &ldquo;I was obliged to do it. We&rsquo;ll put you back presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he searched thoroughly the mattress and the bedstead, but there was no
      photograph.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused and wiped, his brow. The Soudanese stood at attention by the
      side of the bed. Jetsam looked at Jake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and fetch him down,&rdquo; he said peremptorily to the Soudanese.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jake vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One way or another this shall end,&rdquo; he murmured, gazing at the old woman
      in her lowly position among the heaped confusion of the floor; and he
      waited, eyeing at intervals the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the door opened, and the Soudanese came in, and he was leading
      by the hand Josephus Ilam. Jetsam stepped quickly behind them and shut and
      locked the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, Ilam,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;sit down. Make him sit down, Jake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And quite obediently Ilam sat down on a chair, near the night-table. He
      made no remark; he scarcely looked round; his senses seemed to be dulled;
      it was as though his mind had retired to some fastness from which it
      refused to emerge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Ilam demanded gloomily. &ldquo;What have you been doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make one last appeal to you, Ilam,&rdquo; said Jetsam. &ldquo;I
      kidnapped you for this, I may tell you. I was determined to confront the
      mother and the son if necessity should arise. But you nearly did for me by
      swallowing too much of that blessed opiate. You are clumsy, even when you
      are a victim. However, you&rsquo;ve got over it nicely, haven&rsquo;t you? Pretty
      notion, wasn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;to conceal you in your own attic, where
      no one would ever think of looking for you? But it wanted doing, my
      weighty friend&mdash;it wanted doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you after?&rdquo; Ilam asked again, as if in the grip of one fixed
      idea. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the money&mdash;what else do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know perfectly well what I want,&rdquo; said Jetsam. &ldquo;My case is complete
      except for that photograph, and I&rsquo;ve secured as much money as will keep me
      on my pins till I&rsquo;ve forced you to see reason. But the photograph is
      lacking; you are aware of that. It&rsquo;s certainly rather hard lines on you
      that you should be forced to give up the very thing whose possession by me
      will ruin you. But what would you have? I am desperate, and no one knows
      better than you and this sad creature here that my cause is just. Tell me
      where the photograph is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; said Ilam doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jetsam turned to Mrs. Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, murderess,&rdquo; he said, and Ilam shuddered at that word: &ldquo;if you do
      not answer my questions I will kill your son before your eyes. Does Ilam
      know where the photograph is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once again the old woman obstinately shut her eyes and refused to give any
      indication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilam, who seemed mentally to be quickly regaining his normal state, stood
      up and moved to the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand!&rdquo; said Jetsam angrily, and he drew his revolver from his pocket. &ldquo;I
      will know where that photograph is or I will hang for you. I shall not be
      the first man who has died in a good cause. Now, where is that photograph?
      Did you or your mother take it out of the box?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted the revolver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took it out of the box,&rdquo; snarled Ilam&mdash;&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;and
      my mother knew nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is it?&rdquo; asked Jetsam, smiling triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is here,&rdquo; Ilam cried, and he took a faded photograph from his breast
      pocket. &ldquo;You never thought of searching me, eh? Ass!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it me,&rdquo; said Jetsam quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ilam; and with a sudden movement he stuck it in the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flame destroyed it in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jetsam sprang towards him, and then fell back as if stunned. Jetsam was
      beaten, after all. He gave a sort of groan and walked to the other side of
      the room, as if in a dream. He had failed, and he meant to commit suicide.
      All his trouble, all his risks, had gone for nothing. He raised the
      revolver again, and no one in the room quite guessed the tragedy that was
      preparing for them. His finger was on the trigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately behind him was a draught-screen, and the draught-screen began
      mysteriously to sink forward. It lodged lightly on his shoulders. He
      turned, the revolver at his temple; and round the screen, from behind it,
      appeared Rosie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; she said calmly, and she took the revolver out of his
      unresisting hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jetsam turned round, saw that the person who had so mysteriously
      interfered was Rosie herself, and sank down on a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done me an evil turn,&rdquo; he breathed, at the same time with a
      gesture ordering the Soudanese to leave the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have saved your life,&rdquo; she said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, with a trace of bitterness. &ldquo;That is what I mean. You
      are not the first who has saved my life. And if the first saviour had
      refrained we should all have been happier now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not say that,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you would never have met me,&rdquo; he said curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad I have met you,&rdquo; she retorted, bravely facing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;And yet you play tricks on me! Yet you make promises to
      me and break them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I only promised to go to the boat, and I would have
      gone to the boat afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not go at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She told him how she had gone by accident into Pauline&rsquo;s bedroom and found
      it empty, and how thus all her suspicions were aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid your plans might fail,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and you had threatened to
      kill yourself if they failed; and I thought something dreadful might
      happen during my absence. And so&mdash;so&mdash;I hid myself here&mdash;without
      thinking. I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And tears came to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few minutes ago I might have been seriously perturbed by what you have
      told me,&rdquo; said Jetsam. &ldquo;But what does it matter now? If your sister is
      against me, if the house is surrounded by spies, it makes no difference. I
      wanted to kill this man here. I should have killed him; but I thought of
      the annoyance it would give you. Yes,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;I did really. Not to
      mention the futile trouble it would cause me. And on the whole I regarded
      it as simpler and neater to kill myself. But you have stopped that. Will
      you oblige me by putting down that revolver? It is at full cock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not touch it?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not touch it,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid it at the foot of the bed, and then bent down inquiringly to old
      Mrs. Ilam, who rested with closed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is asleep,&rdquo; murmured Rosie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank heaven! She sleeps very heavily sometimes. Will you not put
      the bed back in its place? I do not like to see it here. It is painful,
      very painful, in spite of all you have told me about her, to see this. She
      is very old and very helpless.&rdquo; During the conversation Ilam had remained
      in a sort of stupor. It was as though the effort of putting the photograph
      in the fire, and then the shock of Rosie&rsquo;s sudden appearance, had
      exhausted the energies which he had managed with difficulty to collect as
      the results of the narcotic passed away; it was as though the narcotic had
      resumed its sway over him for a time. But now he came brusquely forward,
      taking two long steps across the room, and stood between Rosie and Jetsam,
      and he put his face quite close to Rosie&rsquo;s face, as an actor does to an
      actress on the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you this scoundrel&rsquo;s accomplice?&rdquo; he asked hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; said Rosie, &ldquo;Mr. Jetsam is not a scoundrel, and I am nobody&rsquo;s
      accomplice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has nearly killed me, and he has robbed me of two thousand five
      hundred pounds,&rdquo; pursued Ilam. &ldquo;If that is not being a scoundrel, what is?
      Tell me that. You are his accomplice. You came into this house to serve
      his ends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I did not,&rdquo; protested Rosie, &ldquo;I came into this house with my
      sister at your urgent request.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sneered Ilam. &ldquo;That is what you made me believe, you chit! You
      worked it very well; but I know different now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until I came here I had never seen Mr. Jetsam,&rdquo; said Rosie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come to understand each other remarkably well in quite a few
      days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we have,&rdquo; admitted the girl. &ldquo;But if you object you have a simple
      remedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say he is a thief and almost a murderer. You say that I am his
      accomplice; we are criminals therefore. Bring us to justice. Have the
      entire affair thrashed out, Cousin Ilam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that I cannot do that,&rdquo; said Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am well aware that you dare not,&rdquo; said Rosie. &ldquo;The scandal would be
      intolerable. Think of Pauline&rsquo;s feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose Pauline, too, is in the conspiracy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There would always be the scandal. It would ruin the City.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is neither the scandal nor the City that you are thinking of, Cousin
      Ilam,&rdquo; said Rosie. &ldquo;It is merely yourself or your mother. If it is your
      mother, well and good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ilam retired a couple of paces, uncertain what to say in reply, and
      possibly fearing some attack from Mr. Jetsam, who stood behind him. There
      was a silence, and then Ilam murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my poor mother, sleeping there in the midst of all this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a cry from the strange man&rsquo;s heart, and another silence ensued. The
      situation had reached such a point as baffled all the parties to it to
      discover a solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Jetsam who broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will leave you,&rdquo; he said in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said, as no one replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going to?&rdquo; asked Rosie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am merely going,&rdquo; answered Jetsam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will tell me where?&rdquo; she insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is vague,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Out of your life&mdash;that is all I can say.
      It was too much to hope that at the end of a career which has been one
      long and uninterrupted misfortune the sun of happiness should shine on me.
      I was destined to failure from the beginning. You do not know all my
      story; but you know some of it&mdash;enough to enable you, perhaps, to
      forgive me. Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not leave me like that,&rdquo; said Rosie. &ldquo;You dare not leave me like
      that. You are going to kill yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have got over that caprice, I think. I shall drag out my
      existence to its natural end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your address,&rdquo; Rosie said doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are cruel,&rdquo; she whimpered. &ldquo;After&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was interrupted by Ilam himself, who said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosie, go downstairs. I have two words to speak to this fellow. Go
      downstairs. Leave us.&rdquo; His tone was cold and acid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jetsam agreed after a moment. &ldquo;Leave us; we have to speak to each
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not go without seeing me?&rdquo; asked Rosie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; replied Jetsam, and the next instant the two men were alone
      together in the room, save for the unconscious form of Mrs. Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door had been locked again, this time by Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is in love with you,&rdquo; Ilam shouted fiercely. &ldquo;You have imposed on
      her; you have taken advantage of her ignorance of life, and she is in love
      with you! It is infamous. I am stronger than you, and unless you promise
      me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo; Jetsam stopped him. &ldquo;What are you raving about? You must be mad.
      You must have forgotten&mdash;as your mother forgets. As for this poor
      girl being in love with me&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo; He stopped with a hard laugh.
      &ldquo;What has that to do with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has everything to do with me,&rdquo; cried Ilam, and, as if transported by
      fury, he suddenly sprang on Jetsam, who was all unprepared, and, clasping
      him in a murderous embrace, threw him to the ground. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of
      you,&rdquo; he ground out the words through his teeth. &ldquo;And if I finish you, I
      can easily show that it was in self-defence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he had scarcely spoken when his hands fell lax in astonishment and
      alarm, for immediately outside the window, or so it seemed, there sounded
      four notes of a trombone, brazen, clear, and imposing in the night. No one
      who has heard Beethoven&rsquo;s greatest symphony will ever forget the four
      notes&mdash;commonly called the notes of fate&mdash;with which the most
      tremendous of musical compositions opens. It was these notes which the
      trombone had given forth. There was a silence, and the instrument repeated
      them, and in the next pause that followed, the two men who an instant
      before had been joined in a dreadful struggle, lay moveless, listening to
      their own breathing; and a third time the trombone sounded.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII&mdash;The Dead March
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Pauline,
      standing outside Carpentaria&rsquo;s bungalow, had communicated to Carpentaria
      the fateful fact that all Ilam&rsquo;s servants had disappeared from their
      rooms, and had given expression to the vague and terrible fear that was
      beginning to take possession of her, the musician said in reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have every reason to be afraid, and yet I shall ask you to try to
      calm your apprehensions. Whether the servants are there or not, nobody can
      get into your house without our knowing it, and when anybody starts to
      attempt to get in, there will be plenty of time for you to alarm yourself
      then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Rosie alone there with poor Mrs. Ilam!&rdquo; sighed Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Ilam can&rsquo;t do her any harm, at any rate,&rdquo; said Carpentaria
      comfortingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that he commenced a cautious perambulation of the exterior of
      Ilam&rsquo;s house, Pauline following him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would go to my sister until I have something to report,&rdquo; he
      murmured. &ldquo;You will take cold, and you will work yourself up into a fever,
      and do no good to anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not work myself up into a fever,&rdquo; replied Pauline firmly. &ldquo;I am
      capable of being just as calm as you are yourself. Let us go at once into
      the house&mdash;let us go to Rosie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; expostulated Carpentaria, &ldquo;and spoil whatever scheme is going on?
      No, my dear young lady, we have gone so far that we must go a little
      further. We must catch the schemers red-handed. If we do not, our night&rsquo;s
      work will have been wasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The idea of weakly and pusillanimously changing a course of conduct at the
      very moment when that course promised the most interesting adventures
      shocked all the artist in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stared blankly at the house, whose form was clearly revealed in the
      misty moonlight, but none of whose windows showed the slightest glimmer of
      light. It was an extremely modern tenement, and its architecture was in no
      way startlingly original; nevertheless, in those moments it seemed to both
      of them the strangest, the most mysterious, the most insubstantial house
      that the hand of man had ever raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Pauline clutched his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear some one walking somewhere in the grounds,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both listened. In the stillness of the night regular steps sounded
      plainly from a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the patrol on the terrace,&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is assuredly on the terrace&mdash;the sound of heavy boots on stone
      flags, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Pauline agreed, loosing his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were twenty or thirty yards from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to be brave and to do something for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria turned to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the patrol, and tell him I have sent you, and that he is to remain
      within sight of the boat there, until further orders, keeping as much in
      the background as possible. Will you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone. There is no danger. Besides, one of us must remain here, and one
      person can more easily keep out of sight than two. My fear is that the
      boat may be used again. The patrol is not to prevent the boat being used.
      He is not to show himself; he is merely to observe. You understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you insist on my going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I entreat you to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And without more words she went. It was her figure, and not the figure of
      Rosie, that Mr. Jetsam had seen in the gardens when he peeped out of the
      window of Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria, now alone, recommenced from a fresh spot his vigil over the
      closed house. He argued with himself with much ingenuity as to what point
      the persons who wished to enter it would choose for their appearance, but
      he could decide nothing. They might, he thought, come by the avenue, or
      round by the back from the other side of the buildings of the Central Way,
      or even through the gardens. He was growing impatient of a delay
      apparently interminable, and then his glance happened to wander upwards to
      the roof of the house. He could not see the roof itself, because he was
      now too near the wall, but it appeared to him that he detected a
      phenomenon above the roof which was somewhat unusual. He walked carefully
      away from the house until the expanse of roof became visible; and, indeed,
      he had not been mistaken. There was a radiance there. The small square
      pane of the attic, flat with the surface of the roof itself, was
      illuminated, and sent up a faint shaft of light into the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly he saw his own shortcomings as a counter-schemer against
      schemers. He had assumed that the schemers were not already in the house,
      whereas he had had no grounds for such an assumption. The schemers were
      most obviously in the house, and they had most obviously been there for a
      considerable time, since no one could have recently entered it without his
      knowledge. He was angry with the schemers, and he was more angry with
      himself, and one of those wild ideas seized him&mdash;one of those ideas
      which could only occur to a Carpentaria. He would catch these schemers
      himself, by his own devices, and he would do it leisurely, dramatically,
      and effectively. He would make such a capture as never had been made
      before. He did not know precisely who the schemers were, nor their
      numbers, nor their nefarious occupations in the house; and he did not
      care. When once he was in the toils of a grand romantic idea he cared for
      nothing except the execution of it. He laughed with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you laugh?&rdquo; said a voice behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Pauline, who had returned. She had given the instructions to the
      patrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An idea,&rdquo; he replied&mdash;&ldquo;a notion that appealed to me.&rdquo; And then he
      perceived that he must at all costs get rid of Pauline, and he continued:
      &ldquo;My sister is extremely disturbed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will you not, as a last
      favour, go and stay with her? Do not refuse me this. I will find some one
      to assist me in my work here&mdash;one of my trombone-players on whom I
      can rely. I&mdash;I really do not care for you to be out here like this.
      The strain is too much for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Rosie&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she objected again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosie is all right,&rdquo; he reassured her. &ldquo;I will answer for Rosie&rsquo;s safety
      with my life; and when I say that, I mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do as you wish,&rdquo; said Pauline at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see you into the house,&rdquo; he murmured, enchanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He unlocked his front-door for her, and called out softly, &ldquo;Juliette!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Carlos?&rdquo; said a voice in the darkness at the top of the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here is Miss Dartmouth come to keep you company. Do not
      use a light&mdash;at least, use as little light as possible, until you
      hear some music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear some music? What music?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind what music. If you should hear some music you will know that
      you are at liberty to turn on all the lights you like. Miss Dartmouth will
      tell you why I want darkness at present. Here are the stairs, Miss
      Dartmouth. Cling to the rail. <i>Au revoir.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; faltered Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Au revoir</i>, I said,&rdquo; he whispered insistently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before leaving the house he rushed into the kitchen, found a long
      clothes-line, of which he seemed to know exactly the whereabouts, and
      appropriated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next minute he was tying the handle of Ilam&rsquo;s front-door firmly to the
      railing, so that it would be impossible to open the door from the inside.
      He secured in the same manner the side-door and also the gate in the wall
      of the kitchen yard. He then fixed pieces of rope under windows, in such a
      manner that a person endeavouring to leap from a window to the ground
      would almost certainly be caught in the rope, and break a leg or an arm,
      if not a neck or so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheerful for them!&rdquo; he murmured maliciously. &ldquo;I only hope it won&rsquo;t be
      Miss Rosie who tries to make her exit by the window. I have answered for
      her. However, I must take the risks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced finally round the house, throwing away some short unused pieces
      of rope, but keeping two long pieces. He surveyed the house with
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can safely leave it for five minutes or so now,&rdquo; he said to
      himself; and he shut his penknife with a vicious snap and put it in his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he ran off at a great speed in the direction of the Central Way. At
      the southern end of the Central Way, nearly opposite to the general
      offices of the City, was an elegant building known as the band-house. Here
      dwelt the majority of the members of Carpentaria&rsquo;s world-renowned
      orchestra. Some members, being married to women instead of married to
      their art, had permission to possess domestic hearths in London and the
      suburbs, but these were few. The edifice was a very large one, as it. had
      need to be. A peculiar feature of it was the rehearsal-room on the top
      floor, constructed, like the finest flats in New York, in such a manner as
      to be absolutely sound-proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria rang the electric bell at the portals of the band-house, and
      the portals were presently opened by a sleepy person whose duty it was to
      admit bandsmen returning after late leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; said the porter, &ldquo;this is a bit thick, this is. Do you
      know as the hour is exactly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue, you fool!&rdquo; Carpentaria stopped him briefly, &ldquo;and go and
      bring Mr. Bruno to me at once; it&rsquo;s very important. Let&rsquo;s have some
      light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon, sir,&rdquo; said the porter, astounded by this nocturnal
      apparition of the autocrat of the band. &ldquo;Mr. Bruno is asleep, sir. He had
      two whiskies to make him sleep, and went to bed afore midnight, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he&rsquo;s asleep. Do you suppose I thought he was standing on his head
      waiting for the dawn? Go and waken him&mdash;and quicker than that! Here,
      I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men went upstairs together, and Mr. Bruno, principal
      trombone-player of the band, was soon sitting up in bed, awaking to the
      presence of his chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bruno, my lad,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, &ldquo;give me your trombone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My trombone, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;Mendelssohn once remarked that the trombone was
      an instrument too sacred to use often, but I think the supreme occasion
      has arrived for me to use it to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s there, in the corner, sir,&rdquo; said Bruno, wondering vaguely what was
      this latest caprice of Carpentaria&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria rushed to the thing, took it out of its case, and put it to
      his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; he murmured, after he had sounded a note gently. &ldquo;I can do it, I
      think. Listen, Bruno! The occasion is not only supreme; it is unique. You
      are to rouse all the men; you are to dress, and take your instruments; and
      you are to go out quietly and surround the bungalow of our honoured
      President, Mr. Josephus Ilam. You are to make no noise of any kind until
      you hear me give the first bars of a tune, either with my mouth or with
      this instrument. You are then to join in that tune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What tune, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall you be, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see. Get up, now; don&rsquo;t lose a second.&rdquo; Carpentaria was off
      again. He returned to Ilam&rsquo;s house, and climbed to the balcony of the
      window of Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s bedroom. It was fortunate that he had preserved the
      rope, for he could not have climbed with the trombone in his arms. His
      method was to leave the trombone on the ground, the rope tied to it; he
      kept the other end of the rope in his hand, and drew the trombone after
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was that he sounded on the trombone the terrible phrase of
      Beethoven&rsquo;s, which put a period to the struggle between Ilam and Jetsam.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt for the handle of the French window, and, finding the window
      fastened on the inside, adopted the simple device of leaning with his full
      weight against the window-frame. The whole thing gave way, and through a
      crashing of glass, a splintering of wood, and the tearing of curtains he
      backed into the room, the trombone held precariously in one hand and his
      revolver very firmly in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene that confronted him was sufficiently surprising. Amid the
      extraordinary disorder of the chamber he found its three occupants all
      stretched on the floor. The old woman was apparently oblivious, but the
      two men, releasing each other, gazed at him for all the world like two
      schoolboys caught in an act contrary to discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I startle you? I hope so,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, when he had found his
      bearings. &ldquo;I meant to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jetsam was the first to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You with the red hair!&rdquo; cried Jetsam. &ldquo;You are trying to save my life
      again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind my red hair,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, ruffled. &ldquo;I am not trying to
      save anybody&rsquo;s life. I&rsquo;m here on a mission of inquiry. No one leaves this
      room until I have had a full explanation of everything. I have stood just
      about as much as I can stand of the mystery that has been hanging over
      this City for a week past. Ilam, let me beg you to get up and take a seat
      over there in that corner. Thanks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He relinquished the musical instrument as Ilam clumsily resumed his feet
      and obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for you, Mr. Jetsam,&rdquo; continued Carpentaria, &ldquo;you know, from accounts
      which have reached me, the precise moral effect of a loaded revolver such
      as I am now pointing at you. Go into the other corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Jetsam. &ldquo;You can fire if you like. As a matter of fact,
      you daren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You propose to leave the room and defy me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I propose to leave the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the trombone and blew on it loudly a few notes which neither
      Jetsam nor Ilam immediately recognized. But the musicians, who had by this
      time surrounded the house, recognized them. And at once there entered by
      the smashed window the solemn and moving strains of the Dead March in
      &ldquo;Saul.&rdquo; The house seemed to be ringed in a circle of awful melody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jetsam shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now kindly stay where you are,&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jetsam stayed where he was, at the foot of the bed, his back to Mrs.
      Ilam&rsquo;s prone figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The playing continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What foolery is this?&rdquo; demanded Ilam slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is part of a larger piece of foolery that has rescued you, Ilam,&rdquo;
       Carpentaria replied, and he was crossing the room to approach Ilam, when
      he saw something in the looking-glass over the mantelpiece, and he started
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ilam, the paralytic, roused in some strange way, either by the
      violence of the scenes at which she had assisted, or by the inexplicable
      influence of the music, was almost erect in her bed, and her trembling
      parchment hands had seized the revolver which Rosie had left on the floor,
      and she was endeavouring to point it between Jetsam&rsquo;s shoulders. The other
      two men turned and saw the fatal and appalling movement of the aged
      creature, who was evidently in the grip of some tremendously powerful
      instinct&mdash;the kind of instinct that only dies with death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria alone retained his self-possession. With a swift and yet
      gentle movement he disarmed the terrible old woman, and she sank back,
      with streaming eyes, helpless and moveless as before. The incident was
      over in a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, &ldquo;I will hear your story, Mr. Jetsam. But
      first, we must lift this bed back to its proper-position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Jetsam, trembling in spite of himself. &ldquo;You shall
      hear my story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The music ceased.

      CHAPTER XXIX&mdash;Mr. Jetsam&rsquo;s Recital
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e will go
      downstairs,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, when a certain amount of order had been
      restored to the room. &ldquo;We shall be more at ease there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried Jetsam, and there was a note of passion in his voice. &ldquo;This
      old woman shall hear my tale. I tell it in her presence, or I tell it not
      at all.&rdquo; Carpentaria gazed at Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s eyes, which made no response.
      Her bed was now replaced in its proper position, and those strange burning
      eyes perused their old spot in the ceiling. After the brief and terrible
      return of activity to that stricken body, it seemed to have sunk back into
      a condition of helplessness more absolute even than before. The eyes
      burned, but not quite with their former disturbing brilliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Carpentaria agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilam was already seated, apparently half-comatose. The other two men each
      seized a chair. And then there was a timid but insistent knocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; demanded Carpentaria of Jetsam. &ldquo;You ought to know; you
      have been master here for some hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Miss Rosie, I imagine,&rdquo; Jetsam answered. &ldquo;Your singular music has
      startled her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria walked rapidly to the door, unlocked it, and opened it. Rosie
      it indeed was who stood there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear young lady,&rdquo; he said lightly, without giving her an
      opportunity even to express her astonishment. &ldquo;I would like you to go to
      your sister, who is in my house over the way. But I fear you cannot open
      any of the doors. Won&rsquo;t you retire and rest a little, after your
      complicated labours?&rdquo; He smiled a little grimly. &ldquo;Everything is all right
      here, and should your aged relative need your ministrations you may rely
      on me to call you. In the meantime, your cousin and I, and your particular
      friend Mr. Jetsam, must have a chat on business matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed, covering the aperture of the door with his body so that Rosie
      could not see inside the room. As for Rosie, she hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I entreat you,&rdquo; he insisted, &ldquo;go and rest, and don&rsquo;t have anything more
      to do with boats; you might drown yourself. And believe me when I say that
      nothing further will be done in secret. The moment I am free I will
      endeavour to free the doors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosie moved reluctantly away down the landing. She had not spoken a word.
      Carpentaria closed the portal softly and retired to his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have my attention,&rdquo; he remarked significantly to Mr. Jetsam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jetsam, after a moment&rsquo;s pause. &ldquo;It goes back a very long
      time, this affair does, Mr. Carpentaria. It certainly began before you
      were born&mdash;down at Torquay. Torquay, according to what they tell me,
      was not the place then that it is now, not by a considerable distance; but
      it was fashionable. It had got a bit of a name as a good place to go and
      get fat in. Perhaps that was why a certain soda-water manufacturer went
      there to spend a year or so. He was a very wealthy man, and he rented a
      villa there. It&rsquo;s one of those villas on the top of the hill between Union
      Street and the sea, and it still exists. His age was about fifty, and he
      was supposed to be worth half a million or so&mdash;all made out of gas
      and splutter, you see. Being supposed to be worth half a million or so, of
      course he soon had the entire population of Torquay knocking at his door
      and throwing cards into his card-basket. He made a wide circle of friends
      in rather less than no time, and being a simple, decent creature, though
      not faultless, he was pretty well pleased with himself. Now among the
      friends that he made was a certain widow, age uncertain&mdash;but in the
      neighbourhood of thirty, and her name was Kilmarnock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this time Mr. Jetsam stood up, and bending over Mrs. Ham&rsquo;s bed with his
      smile so ruthlessly cruel, he repeated, staring at the invalid:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her name was Kilmarnock, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ilam made no sign. Mr. Jetsam resumed his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty woman, I believe she was, with magnificent black eyes; the most
      wonderful eyes in the West Country, people said,&rdquo; Mr. Jetsam proceeded.
      &ldquo;Husband dead some little time. Anyhow, she had gone out of mourning, and
      her dresses were the amazement of the town. They&rsquo;d look pretty queer
      nowadays, I reckon, because that was before 1860. However, her dresses
      have got nothing to do with it, especially as the soda-water manufacturer&mdash;have
      I happened to mention that his name was Ilam?&mdash;especially as Mr. Ilam
      couldn&rsquo;t see them very well. Mr. Ilam was beginning to suffer from a
      cataract; both his eyes were affected, and the disease was making progress
      rapidly. You must remember that oculists didn&rsquo;t know as much about
      cataract then as they do now. Well, Mr. Ilam was himself a widower&mdash;a
      widower with one child, aged three years. He had been a widower for two
      years when he first met Mrs. Kilmarnock. He liked Mrs. Kilmarnock. She
      seemed to have in her the makings of a good nurse, and one of the things
      that Mr. Ilam wanted was a faithful, loving nurse. He was certainly in an
      awkward predicament. He also wanted a mother for his child; and Mrs.
      Kilmarnock took a tremendous fancy to the child&mdash;a simply tremendous
      fancy. He was a man who talked pretty freely and openly, Mr. Ilam was, and
      he made no secret of the fact that, though he preferred to marry a widow,
      he would never permit himself to marry a widow who had children of her
      own. And one day he said to Mrs. Kilmarnock that, since he had never heard
      her mention a child, he assumed that she had no children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She replied that his assumption was correct, and that she continually
      regretted being childless, as she adored children, and felt very severely
      the need of something to give her a real interest in life. A month later
      Mr. Ilam asked Mrs. Kilmarnock to marry him, and she consented like a
      bird. Three months later they were married. Everybody said kind things;
      for you must know that Mrs. Kilmarnock was not penniless herself. Oh, no!
      She lived in very good style in Torquay, and gave dinners that Torquay
      liked. And Torquay is a good judge of dinners. Her husband had been a
      Scottish writer to the Signet, she said. So the marriage was celebrated
      amid universal plaudits, and there was quite three-quarters of a column
      about it in the <i>Western Morning News</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Carpentaria ventured to interrupt the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You appear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to be remarkably well informed about matters which
      occurred long before you were of an age to take an intelligent interest in
      them. At the time of this marriage you surely were not in the habit of
      reading newspapers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not,&rdquo; answered Jetsam drily. &ldquo;I had attained the mature age of
      three years. If I am well informed it is because I have taken the trouble
      to inform myself. You see, I was interested, and I have spared no pains
      during this last year or two to acquire all the circumstantial details of
      the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perceive,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;But how were you interested?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will understand presently,&rdquo; said Jetsam. &ldquo;To continue. This Mrs.
      Kilmarnock, whom we must now call Mrs. Ilam, used, both before and after
      her second marriage, to pay visits to the town of Teignmouth, and these
      visits were, not to put too fine a point on it, of an extremely discreet
      nature; they were, in fact, strictly secret. Mrs. Ilam fell into the habit
      of telling her husband that she was going to Exeter to shop, but instead
      of going to Exeter she went only as far as Teignmouth. She was always
      dressed very simply indeed for these Teignmouth visits. She used to walk
      through the town from the station, and, having taken the ferry across the
      Teign, she walked up the right bank of the river till she came to a
      cottage that stood by itself in the marshy land thereabouts. At the
      cottage an old man and woman and a little boy would meet her. And the
      strange thing was that the old man spoke French; he could not speak
      English. You may possibly not be aware that onion-boats from the coast of
      Brittany are constantly arriving at the smaller Devonshire ports, such as
      Torquay and Teignmouth. The old man was a Breton peasant, with all the
      characteristics of a Breton peasant, who had arrived at Teignmouth once in
      an onion-boat, and forgotten to go back again because he fell in love with
      an Englishwoman&mdash;a Devonshire lass with a soft drawling accent. So
      Mrs. Ilam used to talk to the Breton peasant in French, and to his wife in
      English, and to the boy in baby language. She would cover the boy with
      kisses; she would call him by pet names, and she saw him at least once a
      week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was her son?&rdquo; Carpentaria put in interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have naturally guessed it,&rdquo; Jetsam responded. &ldquo;He was her son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if she was really a widow, and this was really her son, why did she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Jetsam, &ldquo;I think she was really a widow, and there is not the
      slightest shadow of doubt that this was really her son. Perhaps she kept
      him a secret from Torquay because she felt that he might prove an obstacle
      to the achievement of her desires in Torquay. Anyhow, she loved him
      passionately. Her son was, beyond question, the greatest passion of her
      life.&rdquo; He turned abruptly again to the old woman, &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the aged creature&rsquo;s burning eyes were filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think perhaps it might be as well to leave Mrs. Ilam out of the
      conversation,&rdquo; suggested Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible to leave her out of the conversation,&rdquo; said Jetsam quickly,
      &ldquo;because the conversation is almost exclusively about her. However, I will
      not trouble her any more for confirmation of what I say. Well, for nearly
      a year after her second marriage these clandestine visits of Mrs. Ilam to
      the cottage on the banks of the Teign continued with the most perfect
      regularity, and then something extremely remarkable happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, I must tell you that soon after the marriage Mr. Ilam&rsquo;s cataract
      got rapidly worse. In six months he could only distinguish objects
      vaguely. He could not read anything except shop signs. In Mrs. Ilam he
      found an admirable nurse and companion. Except for her shopping excursions
      to Exeter she never left his side. She was a model wife, and all Torquay
      admitted the fact. Even when Mr. Ilam&rsquo;s impaired vision rendered him
      captious, querulous, and indeed unbearable, she remained sweetness itself;
      and Mr. Ilam would not admit anyone but her to his presence. He even took
      a dislike to his child, his only son, and the infant was left in the
      charge of servants and governesses, except that Mrs. Ilam saw him as
      frequently as she could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is not very remarkable,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, &ldquo;such things are
      constantly happening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming to the remarkable part,&rdquo; replied Jetsam, with a certain
      solemnity of manner. &ldquo;One day the old Breton fisherman told Mrs. Ilam that
      a relative had left him property in his native district, and that he had
      persuaded his wife to go with him to France so that they might end their
      days there. Mrs. Ilam was extremely disturbed by this piece of news,
      because she did not know what to do with the boy. She asked the Frenchman
      how soon he proposed to leave, and the Frenchman said in about three
      weeks. She left and said she would come back again in a few days. It is at
      this point that the remarkable begins. Within a week all Torquay was made
      aware that Mr. Ilam, at the solicitation of his wife, had decided to go to
      Paris to consult a great specialist there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; breathed Carpentaria, while Ilam&rsquo;s face wore at length a look of
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt if you do see,&rdquo; said Jetsam. &ldquo;You think that Mrs. Ilam was
      arranging to go to Paris in order to be nearer her son. Well, she was, but
      not at all in the way you imagine. They departed from Torquay almost at
      once, and in a somewhat remarkable manner, for Mrs. Ilam dismissed every
      servant, even her own maid and Mr. Ilam&rsquo;s man, and the child&rsquo;s nurse&mdash;all
      were dismissed in Torquay itself&mdash;and Mr. Ilam and his wife and child
      left Torquay railway station entirely unaided, except by porters and the
      domestics of a hotel. Mrs. Ilam would certainly have all her work cut out
      to conduct the expedition, for you must remember that at this period Mr.
      Ilam was practically blind. Well, they had to change at Exeter and catch
      the Plymouth express, and at Exeter the old French peasant was waiting on
      the platform, evidently by arrangement, and he held Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s own little
      boy by the hand, and Mrs. Ilam and the peasant had a long talk by
      themselves, and then the express came in, and the Ilams got into it, and
      the express started off again for London, and the French peasant was left
      standing on the platform holding the little boy by the hand. You see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Carpentaria bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; proceeded Jetsam. &ldquo;It was not the same little boy that the peasant
      held by the hand. Mrs. Ilam had taken her own child with her, and left
      behind her step-child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; murmured Carpentaria. &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Jetsam. &ldquo;Only the
      heavens didn&rsquo;t happen to interfere. This was no common case of
      substitution at birth, it was a monstrously ingenious change which Mrs.
      Ilam, out of her passionate love for her own son, had planned and carried
      out in a manner suggested to her by the facts of the situation. Consider.
      The two boys were the same age&mdash;about three years&mdash;and they were
      dressed alike, Mrs. Ilam had seen to that. Mr. Ilam is nearly blind,
      certainly he could not distinguish one child of three from another child
      of three, even if they had been dressed differently. Moreover, Mr. Ilam is
      not interested in the child. He is wrapped up in his own complaint, a
      ferocious egotist, like most sufferers. Probably the child sleeps during
      the journey to London&mdash;probably Mrs. Ilam gives him something to make
      him sleep. The party arrive at Paddington, and are met by a new set of
      servants whom Mrs. Ilam has engaged. She left Torquay with a child; she
      arrived at Paddington with a child. Who, except the old French peasant, is
      to know that there has been a change <i>en route?</i> The new child is
      kept entirely out of Mr. Ilam&rsquo;s presence. He is taught his new name; he is
      taught to forget his past on the banks of the Teign; and he readily
      succeeds in doing so. His new nurse is suitably discreet. During their
      brief stay in London the Ilams stop at a hotel. They do not visit friends,
      on the plea of Mr. Ilam&rsquo;s complaint. Then they leave London for Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing was perfect,&rdquo; observed Carpentaria, astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was fatally perfect,&rdquo; Jetsam agreed. &ldquo;Even had Mr. Ilam been cured at
      once, the danger would have been but slight, because he had never seen his
      own child clearly. However, Mr. Ilam was not cured at once, for it
      happened that the famous oculist whom they meant to consult died on the
      very day they entered Paris. It was seven years before Mr. Ilam got
      himself cured; but in the end he was cured almost completely. The boy was
      then aged ten years. What possible chance was there of a discovery of the
      fraud? Even had Mr. Ilam ever seen his child clearly, what resemblance is
      there between an infant of three and a boy of ten? None; none whatever.
      Mrs. Ilam had triumphed: she had deposed the authentic heir of Mr. Ilam
      and had put her own son on the throne in his stead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the other boy?&rdquo; Carpentaria queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jetsam paused, his eyes bent downwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the Breton peasantry?&rdquo; he demanded suddenly, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well; that doesn&rsquo;t matter! When you hear the sequel of the story you
      will be able to imagine what a Breton peasant is capable of. He is the
      equal of the Norman peasant, and no French novelist has ever yet dared to
      write down the actual! truth about the Norman peasant. I told you that
      Mrs. Ilam and the old Frenchman had a chat on Exeter platform. She told
      him that she was giving him a new charge, preferring to take the other boy
      herself. It was arranged that the new charge should accompany the Breton
      to France, and live with him as his foster-child. Terms were fixed up, no
      doubt to the entire satisfaction of the peasant. Then Mrs. Ilam ventured
      to play her great card. She informed the Frenchman that his new charge was
      a very delicate plant, frequently ill, and not apparently destined to long
      life. This, by the way, was grossly untrue. &lsquo;Of course, if he were to
      die,&rsquo; she said in effect to the peasant, &lsquo;you would lose the income which
      I shall pay to you for looking after the child, and to compensate you for
      that loss I will promise to give you, if he dies, the sum of five hundred
      pounds.&rsquo; I expect she managed to put a peculiar and sinister emphasis on
      these words. Anyhow, the Frenchman understood. That was just the kind of
      thing that you might rely on a Breton peasant to comprehend without too
      much explanation. Five hundred pounds is five hundred pounds; it is over
      twelve thousand francs, and twelve thousand francs to a Breton peasant is
      worth anything&mdash;it is worth eternal torture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, in due course, Mrs. Ilam received news of her stepson&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In due course she received news of her stepson&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; said Jetsam. &ldquo;It
      took a considerable time&mdash;six years, in fact&mdash;&lsquo;but it was
      accompanied by legal proof, and when she received it Mrs. Ilam must have
      been as happy as the day is long, especially as her own boy was growing up
      strong and well, and Mr. Ilam had taken quite a fancy to him. So all trace
      of the crime&mdash;would you call it a crime, or only a pleasing
      manifestation of a mother&rsquo;s love?&mdash;all trace of the crime was lost,
      for the French peasant died; the English wife of the French peasant had
      expired a long time before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Jetsam paused again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am accepting all that you say as gospel,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;Because
      somehow it impresses me vividly as being true.&rdquo; Here he looked at Josephus
      Ilam, who avoided his glance. &ldquo;But how does this matter concern yourself,
      and in what way did you come upon the traces of the crime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; Jetsam recommenced. &ldquo;It was like this. The boy was not
      dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He had run away. He had had a pretty hard time before the death of
      the peasant&rsquo;s wife. Afterwards, his existence was a trifle more exciting
      than he could bear. He was starved and he was beaten. But that was not
      all. On board fishing boats he was forced to accept dangers and risks of
      such a nature that the continuance of his life was nothing less than a
      daily miracle. So he ran away. He was aged nine, and he had a perfect
      knowledge of two languages as his stock-in-trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the legal proof of his death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing simpler. The foster-father was a great friend of the village
      schoolmaster, and the schoolmaster, as you may know, is always the
      secretary of the mayor in a French village. He it is who makes out all
      certificates, and transacts every bit of the routine business of
      population-recording. The foster-father suggested to the schoolmaster that
      in exchange for a certificate of the boy&rsquo;s death, the schoolmaster should
      receive a note of the Bank of France for a thousand francs. This was more
      than half a year&rsquo;s salary to the schoolmaster, and the result was that the
      foster-father got the certificate. No fear of discovery! None knew of the
      issue of the certificate except these two men. And the lady for whose
      benefit the certificate was issued would be extremely unlikely to visit a
      remote French fishing village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what occurred to the boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The principal thing that occurred to the boy is that he is now sitting
      here and telling you his story,&rdquo; said Jetsam, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guessed it,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, with equal calmness, &ldquo;as soon as you
      mentioned that the boy was not dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Josephus Ilam maintained a stony silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knocked about for nine or ten years,&rdquo; continued Jetsam, &ldquo;both in
      England and France, chiefly fishing. Then I suddenly became respectable. I
      got a place in a house-agency in Cannes, chiefly on the strength of my
      knowledge of French and English. Of course, that only lasted during the
      winter season. But my employer had a similar agency in Ostend during the
      summer. It was in Ostend that I became gay. I joined a theatrical troupe.
      I travelled a great deal. I did everything except make money. And after
      ten years of that I settled down again as a house-agency clerk. I really
      was rather good at that, much better than as a music-hall performer with
      revolvers, for instance. And in various &lsquo;pleasure cities&rsquo; of Europe I
      acted as a clerk for over twenty years. Think of it&mdash;twenty years!
      And me growing older and narrower and more gloomy every year in the
      service of &lsquo;pleasure.&rsquo; I never saved any money to speak of, even though I
      remained single, perhaps because I remained single. And then one day,
      finding myself at St. Malo, I thought I would go and have a look at that
      fishing village which I had fled from over thirty years before. My
      delightful foster-father was, of course, dead; so was the schoolmaster;
      but one or two people remembered me, and among them was an old woman who
      had been a charming young girl when I left. It appeared that my old
      foster-father had fallen deeply in love with her in a senile way, and at
      her parents&rsquo; instigation she had married him for his money. He had
      confided to her, once when he thought he was dying, the secret of the
      substitution on Exeter platform. And now she told me. She had always liked
      me. You should have heard her pronounce &lsquo;Exeter.&rsquo; It was the funniest
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jetsam laughed hardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that was how you got on the track?&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I then pursued my inquiries in Torquay, and I found my old nurse.
      She told me that the real child of Mr. Ilam had a large crimson birthmark
      on the calf of his left leg. I had that mark. She also told me that there
      existed a photograph&mdash;one of the old daguerreotypes&mdash;of me as a
      child in the arms of my step-mother, my father standing close by, and that
      the mark on my leg was most clearly visible on this photograph. And that
      was the only real solid piece of information that I obtained, except that
      the photograph used to be kept in an old lacquered box. I had an instinct
      that the photograph had been preserved. And it was preserved&mdash;until
      to-night! I relied on the photograph. I could dimly recollect Torquay and
      Exeter platforms, but of what use would my assertions be without some
      proof, some tangible proof? When I thought of my wasted and spoiled and
      miserable life&mdash;and of what it might have been had I not been hated
      by a woman, I was filled with hatred and with&mdash;with such sorrow as
      you can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sob escaped from Mr. Jetsam, and Carpentaria got up and took his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not too late for justice,&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That woman has always hated me,&rdquo; Jetsam murmured. &ldquo;And even to-night her
      hatred still burned so fiercely that she tried to kill me. Even if she
      could speak, would she admit the truth? And she cannot speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can cause her to communicate with us,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;You
      will see in a moment.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXX&mdash;The Words of Mrs. Ilam
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>arpentaria bent
      over the old woman, as if to search &lsquo;her eyes and find some kindness
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it seemed to him, indeed, that the character of her gaze had somewhat
      changed, though those brilliant orbs, famous in Torquay fifty years ago
      for their splendour, showed no trace of humidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria himself was moved. It would have been impossible for anyone,
      least of all an artist of romantic instincts such as he, to listen to
      Jetsam&rsquo;s recital without emotion. And now, when the narrative was
      finished, Jetsam sat silent and preoccupied, the figure of grief and of
      failure. One felt, in observing him, the immense tragedy of his life&mdash;a
      life which would not have been a tragedy, but merely a little slice of the
      commonplace, had he not by chance learned the sinister secret of his
      origin. One understood how the discovery of that secret had completely
      changed his view of existence, how it had filled him with ideas of frantic
      hope, frantic revenge, and frantic regret at the long drab irrecoverable
      years which the past had swallowed up. One penetrated, as it were, into
      his brain, and watched how he was continually contrasting what his career
      actually had been with what it might have been&mdash;with what it would
      have been but for the ruthless action of the woman on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there was the burly, smitten figure of Josephus Ilam, too,
      equally pathetic in its way. For love of this strong, heavy man, who once
      had been a little boy in a sailor suit standing on Exeter platform, the
      woman on the bed had committed a crime which was certainly worse than
      murder. She had made one life and she had marred another. And now she
      herself was stricken, withered, about to appear before the ultimate
      tribunal. It was incontrovertible that, if she had sinned, she had sinned
      magnificently, in the grand manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria glanced at the two men, and then back again at the aged
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, Mrs. Ilam,&rdquo; he began in a voice strangely soft and
      persuasive, &ldquo;that you can indicate &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo; by a slight movement.
      Miss Dartmouth told me the other day. Is this so? I entreat you to answer
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a sudden jerk Josephus Ilam rose from his chair and rushed to the
      bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer him, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mother and son exchanged a long gaze, and then Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s eyelids
      blinked. It was the affirmative sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Carpentaria simply. &ldquo;Now it seems to me, if you are not
      too tired, that we can quite easily carry on a conversation upon this
      basis. It will be slow, but it will be none the less sure. By successively
      choosing letters out of the alphabet you can make up words, and so form
      sentences. You can choose the letters thus: I will run through the
      alphabet, and when I come to the letter you want, you will blink. Do you
      comprehend my scheme?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes blinked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you willing to try it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a considerable pause, but in the end the eyes blinked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;Now, quite probably you will want to begin
      with the letter &lsquo;I,&rsquo; eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes blinked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent! Your first word is &lsquo;I.&rsquo; Let us go to the next word. A, B, C, D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At &ldquo;D&rdquo; the eyes blinked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      With infinite patience, Carpentaria continued to help Mrs. Ilam to express
      herself, and though that mouth was incapable of speech and those hands
      would never write again, the woman transmitted her first thought to the
      outer world, and it went thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I do not regret</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something terrible, something majestic, in that unrepentant
      enunciation. It illustrated the remorseless character of the aged
      creature, whose spirit nothing apparently could conquer. Josephus Ilam
      moved away from the bed and hovered uncertainly between the dressing-table
      and the window. Jetsam got up from his chair and, taking Ilam&rsquo;s place,
      examined the features of the woman who had ruined his life and cheated him
      out of all that was his. And even Jetsam could not forbear an admiring
      exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are tremendous,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I could almost like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria waved him aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mr. Jetsam told us the truth, dear madam?&rdquo; he interrogated her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the eyes blinked. It was as though they blinked joyously, defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you agree that restitution should be made, so far as restitution is
      possible?&rdquo; Carpentaria asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no movement of the eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You object to restitution, even now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still there was no movement of the eyelids. But Josephus Ilam&rsquo;s legs could
      be heard shuffling on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish to speak, then? A, B, C, D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria went on to &ldquo;W&rdquo; before Mrs. Ilam signified that the sentence
      was to commence. The words ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why named Jetsam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman&rsquo;s mind was evidently exploring, in a sort of indifferent
      curiosity, the side-issues, the minor scenes, of the terrific drama which
      she had started and of which she now witnessed the climax.
    </p>
    <p>
      She appeared to have no sense at all of her own responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a name I gave myself when I first found out who I was,&rdquo; said
      Jetsam bitterly. &ldquo;Something chucked overboard and forgotten, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slight smile seemed to illuminate the woman&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you agree that restitution should be made?&rdquo; Carpentaria repeated
      patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the paralytic made no sign until Carpentaria began again to go
      through the alphabet. Then, letter by letter, the message came:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my son wishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; Ilam murmured, averting his face from the bed, &ldquo;of course I
      wish. I nearly killed him myself the other day. You thought I had been
      dreaming&mdash;till you saw him yourself, and, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped; he broke down.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Mrs. Ilam proceeded, with Carpentaria&rsquo;s help:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son must tell me about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Jetsam put in authoritatively; &ldquo;I will tell you about that. Ilam&mdash;or
      rather I should say Kilmarnock&mdash;is in no condition to make speeches.
      When I first came to this place to begin my struggle for what was mine, I
      really had not got much of a plan in my head. It was so difficult to make
      a start. It may seem to you quite a simple thing&rdquo;&mdash;he turned away
      from Mrs. Ilam and addressed Carpentaria&mdash;&ldquo;to go up to a person and
      say to him, &lsquo;Look here, you are standing in my shoes, and your mother has
      committed an act foully criminal!&rsquo; But in practice it isn&rsquo;t quite as easy
      as it seems. You want a gigantic nerve to make a statement like that as if
      you meant it&mdash;although you do mean it. It sounds rather wild, you
      see. And then I met my supplanter rather before I was ready for him. The
      truth is that he came into that little place where I was hiding in just
      the same way as you came in, Mr. Carpentaria. He caught me like you did&mdash;a
      trespasser; and, of course, I was at a disadvantage. He spoke to me very
      roughly, and then angered me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I know who you were?&rdquo; demanded Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. You couldn&rsquo;t know. But the effect on me was the same. Put
      yourself in my place, Mr. Kilmarnock. I had been cheated out of my whole
      career. You were in unlawful possession of it; and on the top of that you
      came along, and behaved to me as if I were a dog. Well&rdquo;&mdash;here Jetsam
      addressed his stepmother again&mdash;&ldquo;I told him who I was, and pretty
      quick too, and I could see from his manner that he knew the history of our
      origin, and the substitution on Exeter platform.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew,&rdquo; Ilam admitted with a certain sadness. &ldquo;My mother had once told
      me&mdash;I came across traces of a mystery, and she told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you did nothing?&rdquo; queried Jetsam. &ldquo;It was not on your conscience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must recollect that we had the legal proof of your death. What was
      there to be done? I could not have made restitution to the dead, even had
      my mother permitted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when I told you who I was,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Jetsam, &ldquo;unless I am much
      mistaken, you believed what I said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; Ilam agreed. &ldquo;Moreover, you bear a most distinct likeness to a
      portrait of my stepfather, painted when he was about your age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believed me, and your answer was to try to kill me?&rdquo; Jetsam sneered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men, the son and the stepson, were now opposite to one another, on
      either side of the bed, while Carpentaria, intently listening, stood at
      the foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not try to kill you,&rdquo; answered Ilam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You pretty nearly succeeded,&rdquo; said Jetsam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I had killed you,&rdquo; Ilam said gravely. &ldquo;But I had no intention
      of doing so. You said something very scathing about my mother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said nothing that was not justified.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You insulted my mother. I lost my temper. I hated you. We always hate
      those whom we have wronged. I struck you. You fell, and you must have
      knocked your head against the pile of planks lying in the enclosure; you
      never moved. I examined you. I could have sworn you were dead&mdash;I was
      afraid&mdash;I thought of inquests. I knew the whole truth would come out.
      I had not meant to kill. So I took you and buried you temporarily, while I
      considered what I should do afterwards. I went back to the house and told
      my mother. She would not believe me. She thought I had been dreaming. I do
      frequently have bad nightmares. And certain things that occurred
      afterwards made even me suspect that after all I had been dreaming. It was
      not until you came again that I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And even your mother believed then, eh?&rdquo; said Jetsam. &ldquo;Your mother
      believed too suddenly. She saw me and she believed! And the result was
      paralysis! I ought to have broken it to her more gently. That would have
      been perhaps better for all of us&mdash;perhaps better!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. And Jetsam added, as if communing with himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How she hated me! How she hates me still! even to-night, if some one had
      not interfered in time&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not get away from the amazing tenacity of Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish to speak?&rdquo; said Carpentaria, who had been observing the woman&rsquo;s
      eyes; the eyes were blinking nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began the alphabet again, and her message ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not hate him; but I love my son. To-night I thought Josephus was in
      danger. That was why&mdash;revolver. I always acted for my son. I love
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These sentiments, so unmistakably clear in their significance, took some
      time to transmit. Mrs. Ilam appeared to be exhausted. But after a few
      moments she continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Rosie? She helped him. I want to know why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men exchanged glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did she help you?&rdquo; Carpentaria asked of Jetsam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better ask her!&rdquo; replied Jetsam curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria did not hesitate an instant. He went to the door, opened it,
      and called Rosie, and his voice resounded through the well of the
      staircase and the empty rooms. And then Rosie came from; downstairs, like
      an apparition. She had been crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Ilam wants you to explain why you have been helping Mr. Jetsam,&rdquo;
       said Carpentaria, as she entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helping him in what?&rdquo; Rosie parleyed timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his plans&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against me,&rdquo; Ilam added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only helped him in his plans for justice,&rdquo; said Rosie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I was sorry for him. Because there is something in his tone&mdash;because&mdash;oh!
      if he has told you all, are you not all sorry for him? When I think of
      what his life has been&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped and burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my hair is grey,&rdquo; murmured Jetsam. &ldquo;How can you possibly be
      interested in me? What does it matter what happens to me? My life is
      over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Rosie protested. &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t yet begun. It is just
      beginning. Mrs. Ilam and Cousin Ilam will be just to you. You will not
      bear them ill-will. The wrong is too old for that. You will forget it. You
      will forget all the past. Your hair may be grey, but I&rsquo;m sure your heart
      isn&rsquo;t. And your voice can influence even the Soudanese. The way that man
      obeyed you! The way he got the better of his brother just to please you!
      It seems strange, but I can understand it, because I have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jetsam went up to her and took her hand, which she seemed willingly to
      release to him. And he held it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good you are!&rdquo; he said steadily. &ldquo;I am almost ashamed to have roused
      your sympathy so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other two men watched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what Pauline will say,&rdquo; Rosie stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was the sound of music. The band, which everybody in the
      room had forgotten, had begun to play, apparently of its own accord. And
      the melody it had chosen was, &ldquo;See the Conquering Hero Comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria rushed to the window. And then, as he drew the curtains, all
      noticed for the first time that the dawn had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you making that noise for?&rdquo; he demanded angrily from the
      balcony. The music ceased abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re saluting the sun, sir,&rdquo; came the reply. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s morning. We imagined
      that possibly you had lost sight of the fact of our existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had,&rdquo; said Carpentaria. &ldquo;However, you can go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Carpentaria,&rdquo; cried another voice&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s, firm and
      imperious. &ldquo;Open the front door immediately and let me in. I insist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Miss Dartmouth,&rdquo; said Carpentaria obediently. &ldquo;Kindly cut the
      rope which you will see tied to the handle. I will tell the Soudanese to
      admit you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      And presently footsteps were heard on the stairs, and both Pauline and
      Juliette came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosie!&rdquo; exclaimed Pauline. The sisters were clasped in each other&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, dearest!&rdquo; Rosie entreated; and they kissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what have you&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; Pauline began, naturally mystified to
      the utmost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Miss Dartmouth,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, &ldquo;I fear you must wait for
      enlightenment until you can hear the whole story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the servants?&rdquo; cried Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sent them to sleep in the staff-dormitories. I said you wished it,&rdquo;
       answered Rosie, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should I wish it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Rosie. &ldquo;When they asked me that, I told them I didn&rsquo;t
      know,&rdquo; she smiled again faintly. &ldquo;But Mr. Jetsam will explain it all to
      you. I&mdash;I tried to help him, and I have succeeded&mdash;I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this conversation, Juliette, with that direct candour which
      frequently distinguishes women in a crisis, had gone straight to Josephus
      Ilam and seized his hand. She was assuring herself that he was not hurt,
      when Mrs. Ilam once more gave a sign with her eyelids. Carpentaria resumed
      his position as helper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was because I loved him,&rdquo; Carpentaria spelt out for her, &ldquo;that I tried
      to kill you&mdash;twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria fell back. Then he regained his self-command and, pushing his
      fingers through his red-gold hair, he asked monosyllabically, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he interpreted for her the answer to his own question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You worried Josephus. He wanted to get rid of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Josephus disengaged his hands from those of Juliette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; he moaned sadly, and then added, &ldquo;She is mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But through Carpentaria Mrs. Ilam said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not mad. But my love has always been too strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know of this, Ilam?&rdquo; Carpentaria asked his partner solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I did not,&rdquo; was the answer&mdash;&ldquo;not till it was too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, why did you warn me up in the wheel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I suspected. I suspected my poor mother was beginning to hate
      you, and I feared that&mdash;&mdash; I can&rsquo;t say any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria, powerfully moved, walked out of the room, and it was Pauline
      who followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ilam&rsquo;s eyes were now shut.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI&mdash;Unison
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hat summer was
      astoundingly fine and warm, not to say tropical. But since it remains
      clearly in the memory of all, especially of the London water-companies, as
      a unique caprice on the part of the English climate, there is no need to
      go into details of its beauty. Towards the end of September the weather
      was exceedingly lovely. And of course the City prospered accordingly. It
      had been thought that the record &ldquo;gates&rdquo; during the great fêtes of August
      would make the September returns look meagre and feeble. Such, however,
      was not the case. In the first week of September over a million people
      paid fifty thousand pounds at the turnstiles to enjoy the charms of the
      City. And a water-famine in most other parts of London did not impair
      their pleasure, for Ilam and Carpentaria had sunk their own Artesian
      wells, and they had sunk them deep enough. Consequently, the glorious
      lawns of the Oriental Gardens and the turf of the cricket field kept a
      vivid green through that solitary summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consumption of multi-coloured liquids in the cafés dotted about the
      gardens exceeded the most sanguine estimates. It was stated that during
      one of Carpentaria&rsquo;s concerts twelve thousand pints of Pilsen beer (the
      genuine article, imported daily in casks from the Erste Pilsen
      Actien-Brauerei, Pilsen) were consumed within sight of the bandstand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Carpentaria emphatically, &ldquo;is success. No
      composer-conductor,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;has ever before been able to say that he
      was listened to by an audience that put away Pilsen beer at the rate of a
      hundred pints a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he was right. Success was written large all over the place. Success
      shone on the faces of the entire staff, and it shone particularly on the
      face of Carpentaria, though he tried to pretend that it was nothing to
      him. It was, naturally, a great deal to him. He was the lion of London,
      and he knew it. All his previous triumphs were nothing in comparison with
      this triumph, which was the triumph of his ideas as well as a personal
      triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifty amusement-mongers in London were asking themselves why they had not
      thought of building a City of Pleasure&mdash;and they were not getting
      satisfactory replies to the conundrum!
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, towards the middle of September, after a more than usually
      effective concert, Carpentaria laid down his baton on the plush cushion
      provided for its repose, and bowed and bowed and bowed again, in response
      to the enthusiastic plaudits, but with a somewhat pre-occupied mien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with the old man?&rdquo; a French-horn player whispered to his mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dashed if I know!&rdquo; replied the second French-horn-player. &ldquo;Unless he&rsquo;s in
      love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he is,&rdquo; said the first. &ldquo;Everybody knows that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They called him the old man, no doubt, because his age was barely forty
      and because he looked younger than any of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpentaria descended from his throne, smiling absently at the applause of
      his band as he made his way through them to the steps leading down from
      the bandstand to the level of the gardens. He had only to move a few paces
      in order to be lost in the surging crowd. But before he could do this, he
      heard a voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Carpentaria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned sharply. It was a woman&rsquo;s voice. It was more&mdash;it was
      Pauline&rsquo;s voice. Had she come to meet him? Impossible! That would have
      been too much happiness. However, he determined to ascertain, and he
      ascertained in his usual direct manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you come specially to meet me?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she replied, in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was extremely kind of you,&rdquo; he said, trembling with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I had something to tell you&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       She hesitated, and then stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we take a little stroll,&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she said, quite naturally:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should love to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This woman is simply the divinest creature,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;She is not
      like other women. She would like to go for a stroll with me, and she does
      not pretend the contrary. I am a great man, but I have done nothing,
      absolutely nothing, to deserve her goodness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They crossed the gardens, with difficulty, in the direction of the
      terrace. And around were the light and laughter of the City&mdash;the
      brilliant illuminated cafés and the sombre trees for a background, and
      thousands of pretty toilettes and thousands of men gazing at the pretty
      toilettes, so attractive in the gloom under the starry sky. A burst of
      minor music would come now and then from some little café-orchestra, or
      the sound of the popping of guns from a distant shooting-gallery or the
      roar of a lion, forced unwillingly to go through its performance in the
      menagerie. Then, every woman in the gardens gave a little start or a
      little shriek at the noise of the great cannon which signalled the
      commencement of the fireworks, and the rush to the terrace, where the best
      view was to be obtained, became a stampede.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to go on to the terrace?&rdquo; asked Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, teasingly. &ldquo;I mean to go on to the
      foreshore of the river. The tide is low&mdash;we shall be alone&mdash;we
      shall see both the crowd and the fireworks; and we shall be secure from
      interruption.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With one of his pass-keys he unlocked a gate giving access to a tunnel
      leading down to the river. They passed through, and he locked the gate
      again. They arrived at the edge of the stream just as the first cluster of
      rockets was expanding itself in the firmament. The scene was impressive,
      and the roaring cheers of the serried crowd behind and above them did not
      detract from its impressiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have something to tell me?&rdquo; he remarked, tapping his foot idly
      against a stone. &ldquo;I also have something to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He examined her face and figure. She was dressed in mourning, for Mrs.
      Ilam had died within two days of the events set down in the previous
      chapter, and Carpentaria thought that black had never suited any woman so
      well as it suited Pauline.... There was something about her face... In
      short... Well, those who have been through what Carpentaria was going
      through will readily understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are you going to tell me?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a message from Cousin Ilam,&rdquo; said Pauline. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen him
      to-day, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ve been very much alone to-day. Juliette&rsquo;s been away all day&mdash;I
      suppose preparing for the wedding&mdash;there&rsquo;s only a few days left now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Pauline, &ldquo;Cousin Ilam told me to tell you they aren&rsquo;t going
      to be married next week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Carpentaria, &ldquo;after all? Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they were married this morning. They&rsquo;re already on their
      honeymoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Juliette has played this trick on me?&rdquo; murmured Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any case, the marriage would have had to be very quiet,&rdquo; said Pauline.
      &ldquo;I fancy Cousin Ilam didn&rsquo;t particularly care for your notion of having a
      section of your band to play at the church. Anyhow, he wanted the affair
      absolutely quiet. You know how nervous and self-conscious he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I come to think of it,&rdquo; Carpentaria said, &ldquo;Juliette did kiss me this
      morning rather fervently, and I wondered why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wonder no longer,&rdquo; observed Pauline, smiling. &ldquo;It was just a little
      plot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extraordinary! Most extraordinary!&rdquo; Carpentaria exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s quite so extraordinary as all that!&rdquo; said Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what I mean,&rdquo; Carpentaria replied. &ldquo;I also have a message&mdash;for
      you. It is from our friend Mr. Jetsam Ilam and your sister. Have you seen
      Miss Rosie since this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Pauline; &ldquo;she went with Juliette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. She went with Juliette. And she has done what Juliette has done.
      I was asked by Mr. Jetsam Ilam to inform you that instead of marrying your
      sister next week he has married her this week. He is very sorry. He has a
      perfect horror of publicity. In fact they chose the registry office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a shame!&rdquo; cried Pauline. &ldquo;What a shame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Carpentaria, &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t mind them deceiving me! But when it
      comes to deceiving you&mdash;&mdash;! It must have been a united plot on
      the part of those two pairs of people to deceive us two; and, I must say,
      they managed the thing pretty well. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;ve been horrid,&rdquo; said Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we two are quite alone, for one solid week&mdash;you in your house,
      and I in mine,&rdquo; said Carpentaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, and then he heard a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t really crying, are you?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In crying she had lost herself. She had given herself away&mdash;she had
      precipitated a crisis which, in any event, could not have been long
      postponed. In a word, he tried to comfort her. You may guess how he did
      it. You may guess whether she objected. You may guess if he succeeded. In
      a quarter of an hour she was telling him that she had always liked him,
      that, formerly, she and Rosie used to worship him&mdash;Rosie even more
      than she&mdash;but that that sort of worship was nothing compared to the
      feelings which she at present entertained&mdash;<i>et seq</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the fireworks and the applause of the vast crowd provided the kind of
      setting that Carlos Carpentaria loved.
    </p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
